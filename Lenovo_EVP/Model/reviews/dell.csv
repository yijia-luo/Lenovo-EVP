- Easy parking.","Ooh! What an awful slice of dated corporate hell this place is! 

I came in as a University Hire to the sales department, only once there, they had no positions to fill (after lying to us that they did for months), so after hooking us with a signing bonus, they put us doing cold calls 40 hours a week, with no chance at bonuses/commission or advancement. The SWAT sales people not in the University program get the same treatment, only no benefits and $15/hr. One guy had been there 10 months at this rate as they kept stringing him along to becoming a permanent employee, with no end in sight. 

""Culture"" is a word used solely to discriminate against those who are unsatisfactory -- be it due to race, sexual orientation, age, or general intelligence/business sense. Qualifications and experience mean nothing in favor of a low-cut blouse during the forced ""mentoring"" sessions with the piggish (nearly all) male managers. 

As for the bonus structure, Google ""Dell fraud"" and you'll find the company has violated tax laws and misreported it's numbers for TEN QUARTERS STRAIGHT! The ""numbers"" they pay you on and expect you to hit are complete and absolute fiction.

Avoid this place. The only people who succeed there are the ones who wouldn't anywhere else, which is why everyone you meet used to a be a ""shopgirl"" or ""waiter"" until working here. The (likely to be broken promise of) benefits got them hypnotized. This is not a good place to work for anyone with any actual earning potential. 

Since leaving, several hiring managers told me it was a good thing I left and it's actually a mark against you to have Dell on your resume in the tech world, as they have a reputation for not being able to fit in anywhere else.

With this being said, I was blessed enough to have multiple job offers. So why Dell? Personally, Dell stood out. The position, the culture, the pay, the benefits, the work/life balance, the people... it felt too good to be true. From day one, Dell as a company and the people that it employees have been nothing but welcoming to me. They have included me in and out of the office. They have helped me with any questions that I have had and done so with an amazing attitude. They have given me resources throughout Dell to help me get involved in other areas. For example, my manager knew that I loved to party plan and told me about our group ""Winning Culture"" that plans all of Dell's events. I joined the group and have loved every second of it. They have encouraged me, challenged me, and are helping to shape me into the business woman that I'm becoming. The people here GENUINELY care about you. There is so much room to grow and change positions throughout the company. If you accept a sales job here and realize sales isn't for you, no problem. Dell is completely comfortable and actually encourages their employees to bounce around throughout the company to discover what they really love. There is so much opportunity for horizontal (moving from one position to another in a different area of the company) and vertical promotions (moving from one position to a higher position in the same area of the company). I have absolutely nothing but great things to say about this place. As a recent college graduate and this being my first job, I know that doesn't really qualify me to know much about the workforce, but as far as I know, there is no place like Dell.

They provide cake quotas to newbies to prevent turnover while pushing tenured reps out the door with unattainable quotas.  Truth is I made $25k more when I started as 2 levels below what I am now because management buried me in quota as I moved up.  Upper management puts metrics on the reps that they have no clue of effect or backing to prove.  If a team is leading in sales revenue, but lowest on call numbers they catch all holy hell that they need to make calls because that executive NEEDS to prove the calls metric leads to the sales they preached it would.  If the forced metrics don’t meet what they preached it’s their job on the line so they threaten to make sure the numbers meet what they say works.  You never know how your quota is created or given a fair and accurate picture of how it was.  Management can load quota on different team members at their discretion.  Somehow you grow your accounts 20% after a 12% quota increase, but you miss your quota by 25% match doesn’t add up...

Many time there was no a lot of time to incorporate feedback and back flips ensued to get things done prior to launch in a GTM setting. While doing the work leading up to the launch of a product/service/software, executives were regularly updated on messages, positioning, content, deliverables, etc. HOWEVER, not all execs. attended the meetings, there were too many people with input power and a thousand requests for inclusion of other offerings on the products that were sure to get attention. So it was a tough balancing act. It wasn't until everything - especially a press release where all the aforementioned information was on two pages, was there a visceral reaction.  So then come the back flips - to hurry up an change any of the above where translations were already done and paid for...and would have to wait a quarter. Also, sometimes when you had the decision, there were internal fights over the decisions and groups, like development would hold the schedule hostage until one bent to their way of seeing things. HOURS WASTED. Finally, in all the cost cutting that went on, many groups would layoff or reassign people in an organization - let's say Online (responsible for the process and general design of webpages) - to show they were within their target cos-cutting. It looks great on paper, BUT the jobs that were vacated generally rolled up to the marketing manager who already had their hands full with photography, videos, content, brochures, aligning organizations, staying within brand guidelines, coordinating with the communications team, providing feedback on press relases, often time representing Dell at events or press briefings and getting all that coordinated by specific dates for translations, legal review and ultimately launch dates.

There's also an actually decent focus on work/life balance. Aside from the occasional long hours before/during a release to production most people pretty much keep it to 40 hours/week. Most people also have flexibility to work from home at least part of the time.,"To put it nicely, on the whole I would say that Dell (or at least the engineering space) is a giant, inefficient, incredibly frustrating organizational mess. 

When the company went private several years ago a good chunk of the best engineering talent either quit or were laid off. Since then the direction from management seems to have been to outsource about 2/3 of all team members to India and to never get rid of under-performing employees. So over time as many of the great engineers are promoted up or leave the company out of frustration we've seen a steady degradation of overall quality on software teams.

There's also a frustrating amount of red tape to go through for every little thing. Want to deploy a bug fix to a test environment that will unblock several downstream teams for next week's release? Gotta wait until the end of the day when deployments are unlocked for 2 hours or else get a email sign-offs from 5 managers who don't know anything about your project, several of which may be asleep on the other side of the world.

Lastly, over the years I've seen management change hands and departments renamed so many times that I literally don't even pay attention anymore if it doesn't directly impact my team. And especially when upper management is changing around, there's a good chance somebody somewhere is getting laid off. Makes people nervous.

So to kind of sum up my pros and cons here, if you want a relatively stable job with good pay and benefits, decent work/life balance and flexible hours, and you don't mind dealing with a whole lot of frustrating nonsense tangential to your actual work then Dell might be a good fit. But if you're a real go-getter and want an exciting environment to work in then I'd suggest looking elsewhere.",5.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,2.0

They make top down decisions about everything and leave managers constantly struggling to explain and keep up with changes (with zero employee or local management feedback).
The only issue with their healthcare package is for married couples, where the spouse has a full time job at another company. Dell EMC actually penalizes these employees, basically making it more affordable to just drop your spouses Dell EMC coverage.
One frustrating thing at Dell EMC is employee growth opportunities. They constantly have an extremely high turn over rate because people find it easier to leave and come back in order to get more money and/or promotions.
And the final thing that was most frustrating to me personally with Dell (not EMC), was the employee purchase program for Dell products. They provide an annual 17% discount, which is nice, but that 17% is based on the retail price of the products.

I wouldn't call it bad, but workplace perks and efforts to raise employee morale/satisfaction isn't on the same level as most of the surrounding peer companies, including the large tech corporations in the area. Unfortunately, Dell (including DellEMC) does seem to be the type of big tech corporation that only compensates you fairly as you enter the company and doesn't do much to identify and hold on to superior employees. It's pretty standard that TSEs in these kinds of companies only stay for 2-3 years before they're being paid well under market value and move to another company to make any real progress (think 3%/year if you stay vs. staying 2-3 years then moving to another company with a 20% raise... even moving back a couple of years later for matching pay if you want).",4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0

Still, against my better judgement, accepted the position as I was told, ""if you end up not liking the sales position there are thousands of other positions!""

If you enjoy:
micromanagement
being told you'll lose your job if you don't make the sale
cold calling people begging for their business 
Being lied to about your commissions

then this job is perfect for you. I find myself either bored to tears or stressed to tears with no in-between. The turnover here is incredibly high. I've already started prospecting for another job. Why you ask since there are so many opportunities? HA well, you are forced to stay in your position for 18 months and it's virtually impossible to move out of the sales rolls as all these ridiculous metrics they put on you are impossible to obtain. AWESOME. Also beware....when you do decide to look for another job, if you leave Dell within 2 years you have to pay them back your supposed 3 month guarantee of $5,000 (another thing they boast in the onboarding that doesn't exist)

941,"""The most Toxic company in the valley""",I worked at Dell Technologies full-time for more than a year,Nothing I can think of.,"Where to start?

Politics – Totally passive aggressive.  Everyone is pretending to be your friend all the while they are trying to stab you in the back to get ahead.  Head of departments avoid confrontation at all costs.  How do you rise to a VP or SVP without dealing with confrontation? Lying is expected and encouraged here.  This gets funny because they forget which lie they tell to who and routinely get caught and laugh it off.  They won’t outright fire someone, scared to so they pick at people until they’ve had enough and quit.  

Collective IQ – This is the dumbest company I’ve ever worked for, they give new meaning to the Peter Principle.  Now don’t get me wrong, there are smart people here but on a whole, the smart people can’t raise the collective IQ.  Everyone is waiting for their green card to exit this company.

Petty – Had to go over to see it myself.  They have management in another building that counts disposable cups and complains that too many are being used.  They have posted signs on the coffee machine that only people that work in his group or visitors can have drinks or snacks.

Benefits – Worst benefits in the valley, full stop, real third world stuff.  They had a “Tell Dell” survey last year and benefits came out as something major for the company.  In the end the only change they made was reducing the company matching 401K and benefits stayed the same.  When I started, I had to bring in proof that my kids were indeed mine.  People having to pay out of pocket for routine test that at every other company I’ve work at were covered, things like blood tests, x-rays etc. are not covered.  Don’t get me started on their “health screening and wellness”, employees signed their health history away for ~$600 or two months out of paycheck contribution, now they have people’s health history, god knows what they’re planning to do with it.   BTW, if you’re a fan of drug testing, then Dell has something waiting for you.

IT – Absolutely nothing works, their systems, their laptops and/or desktops.  They force an operating system that resembles Windows and everything is locked down, access to outside internet resources, applications, everything, still didn’t stop wide spread virus problems from hitting the company.  Their hardware is the worst, someone in another builds laptop almost started on fire in his bag on the way home.  Machines routinely reboot for no reason and ports are disabled.

They have an application for every function.  There are literally hundreds of applications that you have to use for PTO, Benefits etc. and most only work through IE6.  You have to get permission to have admin rights on your machine but still can’t do anything.  They made a change to accessing email, forcing everyone to windows and outlook, this left the Linux engineering community out in the cold.  All meetings run through Skype which barely works.  It normally takes 5 – 10 minutes to get a meeting started because of Skype issues.

Travel – There isn’t a published process on travel other than to be cheap (except if you’re an executive). I know someone that had a medical issue that had to travel and after a doctor’s excuse and weeks of process hurtles, they got a dispensation to travel in business internationality.  This was scrutinized by management and called into question every time they were required to travel.  Reports on “exceptions” are reviewed by the division heads quarterly and you don’t want to be on that report.

Tell Dell – They tell you that the internal survey is anonymous, yet you have to put in your userid.  You give them honest feedback and they know where it came from.

HR here for their own good.  The have HR reps for every function and they are all over the country.  The routinely skip the people they are working for, manufacture problems and go to the division heads so they can look good.  One of the heads of HR would not meet with employees until they submitted questions in writing.  When they didn’t get enough, the person cancelled meeting with employees because he was afraid of what they might ask him. 

Have and Have nots:  Sr directors and above get perks, travel in business, paid phones, special laptops and other perks setting up a class system in the company.  

And just in case, micro management is also king here, to get an expense report or anything completed it needs to involve at least 4 – 5 layers of management reminiscent of a 1950’s manufacturing culture.

976,"""A Modern Day Sweatshop!""",I have been working at Dell Technologies full-time for more than 10 years,"It is employment, kinda sorta.","The stories you’ve heard are true, it’s a modern day sweatshop. They are hopelessly understaffed, and intentionally so, because it saves them money. They will heap a simply impossible amount of work upon you. You will find yourself spending your entire workday wandering from pointless meeting to pointless meeting. During each conference, you will have several hours of work assigned to you, with no time to actually perform the assigned tasks. At the end of the day, management will simply tell you to “get it done for tomorrow”. The implication being that you’re supposed to get out of work, and then go back to work - from home during the evening. I regularly get email from my coworkers around 3:00 AM because they’re still up at that hour doing the work that they were assigned during the day. They come in to work exhausted the next morning, looking like death warmed over, because they were up working all night and got no sleep. It is common for management to dump 20+ hours of work onto your lap at 4:00 PM on Friday afternoon and order you to have it completed for Monday morning - so much for your weekend. Needless to say, there will be no time for vacations. Just work, work, and more work. What kind of a life is this?

I’ve seen young kids in their early 20’s need to be on medication just so they can cope with their jobs. It will eventually catch up to you and make you sick. When that happens, you become a liability. It would expose the company to further liability if they were to terminate you because they made you sick, so instead they will try to torture you into quitting on your own. They will double down when you are on the verge of collapsing and heap even more work upon you. They will write falsely negative performance reviews and otherwise make you so miserable that you just can’t stand it anymore. If you refuse to quit, you will simply be eliminated in their next round of contrived layoffs, which are pretty much constantly ongoing. Then they will bring in a fresh piece of meat to replace you and work them to death next. I have never seen such an incredible rate of turnover. They should install a revolving door on the front of the building, oh wait, they did! Seriously, the rate of sickness and heart attacks is shocking, several people have even died.

It all boils down to one word: EXPLOITATION. Maximum exploitation of everything and everyone that they come into contact with. I have never seen such a Marxist commodification of human beings. During my orientation, the HR rep actually said “We are the Borg. You will be assimilated. Resistance is futile.” (look up the science fiction reference if you’re not familiar with Star Trek). They went on to tell us that “EMC stands for ‘Eventually Marriage Counseling’ because of all the long hours that we are going to make you work”. They might as well say “welcome to the company, we’re going to ruin your marriage”. Honestly, they actually said these things to us during our orientation!

They expect you to put the company before all else in your life. It is supposed to come before your home, your family, your relationships, your happiness and even your health. This loyalty and dedication will not be returned though, in fact, they will screw you in a heartbeat if it saves them a nickel. Virtue is a vice at this place and they are an inhuman calculating machine that operates completely without a conscience. Their employees mean absolutely nothing to them and “corporate ethics” truly is a contradiction in terms here. There is a striking lack of policy regarding the treatment of workers, and a striking lack of enforcement for what little policy there is. They will berate you, humiliate you, belittle you, insult you and torture you. Coercion is basically the only form of motivation that they know. If your manager wants to put a gun to your head in order to extract an additional 3% output, well that’s just fine with the executives – in fact, it’s commendable. They basically let managers do whatever they want. And you know what they say about absolute power…

HR is complicit in the corruption. When management wants to screw you, it is HR’s function to basically “grease the skids” and see that it is done in such a way that does not expose the company to liability. They are experts in re-writing history, deception, underhanded behavior, dishonesty and getting around the law. It's like something out of the dark ages. You are not going to get a chance to tell your side of the story, you will simply be ambushed on your way into work on some random day. It’s every dirty trick in the book, and several more that they have invented on their own. Every argument is one-sided and they’ve basically discovered that dictatorship is a very efficient form of government.

As a condition of being hired, you are forced to sign the most onerous and draconian document that I have ever seen. It includes such conditions as allowing the company to access your private email accounts and waiving your right to sue. That’s right, you must give up your 7th Amendment rights and agree to resolve any disputes through their arbitration process. I can just imagine what kind of justice you will get from the company court. Just why do you think they’re doing this?

Every relationship is adversarial, rather than cooperative. Management against workers, groups against other groups, workers against each other. Once management realizes that you don’t trust them anymore, they will approach you through someone that you do trust (usually a colleague) and screw you through them. You will eventually arrive at the accurate conclusion that you can’t trust anyone. This culture is completely toxic, but they ridiculously try to sell it as “excellence”.

Incompetent people are constantly promoted to senior level positions, while exceptional workers are trapped in menial jobs. It gets to the point where titles don’t mean anything at all. They would much rather hire cheap workers than talented ones. They especially prefer foreigners or young kids who can be tricked into performing multiple people’s jobs and working 80 hours per week for low pay. Key contributors are regularly eliminated because management basically figures that they have already extracted most of what they’re going to get out of them. Politics is king and the old boy network truly runs the place. Working here is like being trapped in a spider’s web: the more you try to struggle, the more entangled you'll become, and it will eventually kill you. Ultimately, it’s just best to stay away from this place.",1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0

Almost funny when the rescue truck parks directly under their ""Great Place To Work"" banner (it should read: ""Arbeit Macht Frei"").

Their regular and unjustified layoffs are used as purges to eliminate those who can't be legally terminated. Once they make you sick, they see you as a liability to them and you will be ambushed at the next layoff, which is never very far away.

In a blatant effort to remove anonymity from their employee satisfaction survey, management actually exported a copy of the survey onto an external website and forced us all to take it there, before submitting the real one - just so they knew exactly who said what about them.

Senior engineers take decisions on how APIs should look and junior engineers code it out. This model is so flawed that nobody takes complete responsibility for a component. Those who design APIs keep reworking because they lack the insights into implementation details and those who fill in the APIs have little idea of how it applies across components.

Legal team is a big let down and yet the company supports it with max trust. They have messed up so many of the employees through faulty applications, untimely filings, illogical suggestions, and so on. They are totally incompetent and they walk unchecked, unaccountable for any glorious blunders that they do. I have personally seen more than a dozen of my H1B colleagues leave this organization just for immigration purposes. More are in line!! My advice: If you are on H1B, stay away from this place.

Being in bay-area and not have RSUs is like the biggest joke. Once Dell took over EMC, all RSUs were taken away and most of us are left with 50% of TC. Only a small fraction of employees are getting long-term incentives and that's been thrown like biscuits to dogs in the range of 5K-10K for 4 years vesting.

Even people at VP level discuss on issues as small as why this API is looking this way and managers hold meetings all day to go through gory details of several components without having a clue of what they do and how they perform.

Dell does a great job marketing outward but seems to invest very little in people, tools to do the job, etc.  Dell is great at purchasing great companies, but the lack of integration leaves a lot to be desired (this dates back to acquisitions from many years ago ie Kace, Boomi, Credent).  Outside of package selling and leveraging the PC business in cheap base growth strategies, the technology and sales motions are a huge question mark.  

Leadership...I dont know where to even start.  Somewhere between when I started in 2005 and now, the culture and leadership shifted from being one of mentorship and learning to titles and good ole boy clubs.  Dell preaches meritocracy, but it's not implemented in any way, shape or form.  Even voicing a concern - ie not getting paid for something you sold - was extremely discouraged.  Depending on a paycheck within a sales job and feeling like you were getting rewarded for your efforts and earnings was a complete joke.  Across multiple roles, leaders, departments, etc., I finally realized that the CULTURE had completely changed into a toxic environment that required ""dealing with ambiguity"" to be a core competency simply because no one seems to know what they're doing.  Even worse, no one cares.

Dell doesnt do in role promotions or raises - you almost always have to find another job (and hope that there's no hiring freeze on movement) to get a promotion.  If you hear that there is a strategic overlay that is a ""startup inside of Dell"" - RUN.  RUN FAST.  I was part of 4 different ""strategic overlay"" roles, many of which were acquisitions, that shut down within 6-9 months of forming the division.  Trying to interview outside of this crazy environment to leave the company was a constant justification of why I had moved around through so many roles so often -- 1) to make money and 2) because Dell kept shutting down divisions they'd just started.

Depending on the team your on (inbound or outbound) the KPI's are pretty reasonable.

Unlimited overtime, uncapped commission, lots of ""competition"" money available that's not considered part of your quoted pay or benefits, TONS of free food (like some weeks I never had to buy or bring lunch)

KPI's are predictable, and if you're not hitting those they have a good track record  for performance improvement plans. Lots of people go on PIPs and end up having great numbers in the months afterward.

Great opportunity to learn more about technology from both a hardware and software perspective AND once you're in the Dell network it's much easier to transfer to another department or position that you might find more attractive.","Working in the small business segment is a little bit like working in a frat house. The reps are rowdy and whiny. While there are a number of more middle aged employees (people of all ages work on this floor), they tend to hire a lot of young people and recent grads which I think attributes to some of the rowdiness. There are so many ""incentives"" to sell that people end of coddled and throw a fit if they don't immediately get the gift card they won or the free lunch they were promised before. 

Things can change at the drop of a hat. I had an emergency and took a Friday off and when I came in Monday I had a new desk and a new manager. KPI's are predictable, but management will be really slack one week then bring the hammer down the next week (like firing people for not hitting very specific numbers). This pressures the reps to do some shady things. Sometimes management turns a blind eye to these things, especially if it's ""technically"" within the bounds of what's allowed. To give them credit, I have seen reps fired for doing unethical things, and one of the company's core values ""Winning with Integrity"" does come up a lot when people start mentioning those shady practices.

Work life balance is difficult. Putting in longer hours to learn more about the product and processes definitely helps in the beginning, and then even more so when longer hours mean more talk time with more customers. But obviously this is difficult if you have kids.

People get promoted based on good numbers and tenure. While I believe those both matter, a poor salesperson might actually make a good coach, and a good salesperson might make a terrible coach. I've heard of manager's not getting promoted to positions they deserved because they were 1 month outside the required tenure. That's a technicality and shouldn't matter if the person is skilled (which they were).

There's also this growing schism between what they practice and what they preach. Training was like this fairytale land where you could be good at your job and grow into the position with integrity. When you hit the floor it's like every man for himself and you do whatever you can to sell more. At times the manager's will encourage you do what you were trained on, and at other times they say the only things that matter are what you're.",3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0

Team leads that were hired 6 months from the role I started, running the show there way, example would be that if you didn't go by the form that you were supposed to follow, they will put you in a one on one with them in a room and had to explain why we're not following that form.

Also we had to open a case for every call that we take, and take ownership of that case until fully resolving there issue.

Great environment to gain knowledge and insight about computers. Continued learning with certificate earning. 

Great benefits.","Dell has very low retention rates because they micro-manage and under appreciate their employees. The micro-managing is from top level down exploiting the employee and over demanding. They do not pay for everything that you're doing and the L2's 9/10 times are not helpful and get upset when you ask for help constantly as you're trying to learn. 

Metrics are messed up. If you're out of town for vacation, your metrics keep running and lower your numbers which affect you, Your CE is a apart of your metrics which does not help. For example, if a customer is upset because you can't send out a hard drive because of policy rules, the customer can then review you and give you a 1 on your rating from 1 to 10 and bring your CE down massively just because you were following the rules.

Management rarely backs you up and management is terrible. There are some pretty terrible managers out there some who do not have the proper training to lead. 

Your metrics can go down by simply doing your job. If a customer hangs up the phone, you have to call them back and you get bad metrics for returning a call. How is it your fault that the customer disconnected the phone? 

If the customer calls back in for whatever reason even though you're continuously emailing him/her, you get metrics hit.

The metrics prevent you from succeeding there to your full potential. Not much career advancement. 

Extra hard work and effort is not recognized so half the time you're making the same as the guy who is just sliding by at work. 

People quit 3-4 months in the job so you're always having to help train the newbees. 

No work life balance at all. If you're going in at work at 9:00AM and suppose to get off at 6PM, you might not get off until 8:00PM. You can literally receive a call 30 seconds before you're suppose to get off and you can't transfer the call so you really can't make commitments because you never know when you're going to get off. 

You can get in trouble for needing to use the restroom because of ACD. A lot of employees develop anxiety and have high stress levels because of this job and people are truly underappreciated.

You get stuck with a patch of 90-100 set accounts and you can never acquire new customers unless they get rotated to you by management.
