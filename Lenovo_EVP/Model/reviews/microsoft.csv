1,"""Thoughts after 10 years....""",I have been working at Microsoft full-time for more than 10 years,"1.  If you love tech, this is a great place.  No doubt you'll talk tech (mostly the MSFT stack) from enterprise to consumer - from PCs to phones to Xboxes - from datacenter to desktop.

2.  What were GREAT benefits are now VERY GOOD (took a small step down) but still probably better than you'll find at 99% of large corporations.  If you've got family - the value of the benefits is even higher.  401k match is nice.

3.  Even with it's struggles MSFT is still a cash printing machine.  This means if you can keep your nose clean and do reasonable work, you can have a stable job, pay your bills, feed your family, and not worry (too much) about layoffs.  The stock you own likely won't tank, but probably won't go up much either.  You'll get a bonus each year and some stock.  It's a decent life if you aren't looking to light the world on fire.","Brand on Your Resume:  After many years of losing market share and struggling to be at the front end of innovation and the fact that there's 90,000 employees, don't think MSFT is necessarily going to be attractive on your resume to more agile and smaller companies.

Managing Your Career:  Make you say this out loud so it registers - 90,000 employees work there.  Double that for vendors.  It is VERY hard to ""stand out"" and move up in the company.  Don't expect your manager to be much of an advocate or enabler to help you meet your career goals - they are basically trying to survive the stack rank every year too.  Not familiar with the stack rank?  Check out the 2012 Vanity Fair article called ""Microsoft's Lost Decade"".",4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,

Other tech companies it can be a nightmare to just get the basic things you need to do your job but here they go out of their way to make sure you have what you need and are comfortable. Honestly the office is so high end and all my stuff is so nice, I don't even want to go back to my crappy apartment at the end of the day.

The work life balance has been really great so far. I previously worked at a company that everyone claims is the best for work life balance and it wasn't.

I'm hoping it stays that way.","I've heard horror stories from ex-employees and one does not need to go far to find them on the internet. None of that has been my experience so far. There are over a hundred thousand people working here so I don't doubt some teams / organizations could be more miserable. I also work at a satellite office where it is more laid back than on the main campuses.

The downsides I have experienced is it's easy to get out of the loop / disconnected from the other engineers on teams that aren't directly associated with your own team, but teams that you need to work closely with to get your job done efficiently. In other words: it's a big company and it's hard to organize multiple large teams spanning multiple time zones. 

I also am working on a relatively small piece of the puzzle. It seems many people run the risk of being silo'ed. They move people around periodically to prevent stagnation. This isn't really an issue to me because I will do whatever it takes to remain employed so the idea that one should have to always be engaged in the most important tasks etc. has always kind of felt like a giant sentiment of entitlement that most of my millennial cohort adopt so this is not really a con to me.

708,"""Good Company""",I have been working at Microsoft full-time for more than a year,"Services side of the house is pretty good if you carve out a niche for yourself at some good customers. Work-life balance is possible but can be tricky depending on customer location and whether the customer requires 100% onsite (e.g. many Federal customers). Benefits package is actually worthy of comparison when adding to total compensation.  Rewards often match output, especially if you learn what your management/senior leadership are looking to quantify for the region or team's overall performance. 

Access to mentorship can be challenging in Services as opposed to the Engineering or Sales areas, but you have access to most of the company and if you put time into networking, it can definitely be done. Access to some of the best minds and best training in the world, but you need to set good boundaries to balance time spent billable vs training and keeping up. They factor in training time, but you have to schedule it at regular intervals and make sure your customer(s) is/are happy with timing","Challenging for those who have a hard time self-promoting (have to balance between highlighting good/great performance while remaining humble. This is not a company for insanely bright solo performers who have no ability to share their knowledge - a high premium is placed on building upon the success of others (generally not starting from scratch) and promoting the success of others (e.g. build things in such a way that they meet best practices and can be reused in others' projects. In my mind, this aspect is a pro, not a con, but for those who want to go ""lone cowboy genius"" this is not the place for you unless you are really willing to stretch yourself.

While our software is great, our internal tools need work. Things like timekeeping and customer records are accurate but have quirks that make them tedious to use. While management is aggressively looking to replace these, it is slowly progressing. Not the biggest con if you come in expecting it, but it is a bit disappointing given the caliber of the company.

Finally, there are pockets of services where the customer contracts have been written with very little protection for the PFE or Consultant - you may be asked to do something ridiculously out of scope or unreasonable from a man-power/schedule perspective. While this is not generally the case, you will need to network your way through the situation (leverage peer assistance), while working with the Account team to adjust scope. Some contracts may be so bad that you need to quickly rotate out. However, there truly is plenty of opportunity to move around - you are not hired for a single slot like most other services companies.",3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0

Of course it's done verbally behind closed doors and for seemingly unrelated or non-specific reasons, but it's there.  The politeness you see around the company is a thin veneer over the sheer toxicity this company's management has.

The company separates employees into three categories: college hires, industry hires, and internal transfers.  Industry hires are people with experience outside of Microsoft since college. If you're of those then run! They'll treat you like crap. So many good engineers are pushed out of the company.

Judge the CEO by what lower management acts on.  It's not a pretty picture.

This isn’t similar to other companies, this is a constant within Microsoft. Let me give me context.  Yes - MICROSOFT is obsessed with diversity but this also means that often the best qualified person didn’t get the job.  I’ve watched this happen time and time again.  When you interview or “loop” if there isn’t enough diversified candidates then MICROSOFT will redo the interview process - EVEN if a highly qualified candidate was available.  

Every year there’s a high probability you’ll end up in a reorg.  In 5 years I was caught in 4 organizations.  Unproductive and confusing to both employees and customers.  MICROSOFT is not customer obsessed.  Moving roles constantly makes it hard to know your customer well and add value.   Every year my new customers made it a point to let me know how upset they were with the constant shifting.

881,"""Excellent employer on the whole""",I worked at Microsoft full-time for more than 5 years,"If you are fresh out of college, this is one of the best companies to work for. Like many other tech companies, there's a big emphasis on work-life balance and community building. In a lot of ways, it will feel like an extension of college in terms of the learning and events with other young professionals. Senior developers are, for the most part, very happy to mentor younger people and instill a sense of discipline. Internal mobility is fantastic as well, moving from team to team is relatively frictionless and it's Microsoft, so there's a team for almost any area you want to work in. There are so many resources that there's an expert for basically anything you want to know. There's tons of young professionals around too and Seattle is a great place to live. Pay is competitive with the other top companies at a junior level.

Exit opportunities are great here as well. If you pay attention and put effort into your work, you will come out with a brand name that recruiters all over want to see, as well as a disciplined, rigorous skill set to match.","As you move up in ranks, the pay disparity between Microsoft and its competitors (Google, Amazon, Facebook) starts to grow, with Microsoft developers making substantially less than their counterparts. For some, this is okay if they value lifestyle more than career progression. For others, it's common to jump ship to another company.

As with any other big company, there's layers and layers of bureaucracy. For most mature teams, all work will be carefully planned months in advance, specced, discussed in multiple team meetings, with dedicated PMs and testers. In the beginning this is good because it teaches the absolute best, gold standard way to develop large software. After a while, it can become very dull and repetitive though.

The annual review system, which invariably involves peer feedback and encourages backstabbing peers, can be maddening. Even after spending several years here, most people will find it's hard to break off of the railroaded promotion system and really shine as a superstar, just due to the seniority-based culture and siloed nature of the work (you don't have the expertise to move into a management role or more technical area that's already being done by someone more senior, but by never doing that role you'll never build expertise).

Also your experience is hugely, hugely team dependent. Local team culture matters way more than anything that happens at top management level. Two employees at two different teams can have drastically different lives. Maybe the things I list as pros are actually cons in your team, and vice versa. Unfortunately there's no real way to tell what it'll be like working on a team until you actually start working there. You can gauge the number of young vs old developers to get a sense of the culture though.

- Does not offer any holidays off at all, unless requested. And only 3 people per shift can get them off. Everyone else is stuck here on holidays. (upside you get double pay if working on holidays).
- People get hired here with subpar knowledge on how to do the work, which has caused a high turnover rate of talent.

There are no QA teams anymore in most places (because quality is the devs' responsibility) but it's rare to find a team that is willing to allocate enough time to actually write sufficient tests.

Nice and smart people to work with and to learn from.","Just want to claim that below is only witnessed in my org and not sure will be applicable to the whole company. But I'm sure certain patterns are the same across the board.

Politics or clique is a big issue at the company. The CEO is trying to change the company culture. However, you will find strong resistance to the change from many long-time employees. Some people managers are so fake and pretend to care about you. Instead, they will manipulate and twist messages to guard their jobs and step on your head for promotion. Backstabbing is common to benefit one's own career development. 

Conversations are not inclusive, and communication is bad. When you are unfairly treated, there is no place for your voice to be heard or for you to be understood. If you try to explain, you will be regarded as too defensive and not willing to embrace the growth mindset. When there's misunderstandings, basically my manager told me to shut up in a polite way. I also have been shut down multiple times by senior employees when I tried to help them understand things on a project.

Mid-level management don't know how to create clarity. They will use big and vague words to sound smart, but they cannot explain themselves when you ask follow up questions for details or clarification.

Our customers use our technology more than we do. We are just beginning to fully implement Microsoft Teams almost a full year after our customers have struggled with it.

- The more talented people at the company leave. Those who stay are the ones who can't get jobs with similar pay elsewhere. Those who stay and take on work with great ""visibility"" great promoted.

Technical sellers are the most undervalued roles in company.  When its convent, management will speak of its technical sellers as “sales.”  But when it comes to compensation, the technical seller is dead last.  Technical sellers end up doing most of the sales motion (qualification, sales, licensing, pricing &amp; solution estimation) but have little if any upside.  As a technical seller, you can easily work 50+ hours a week with nothing more to show for it than a pat on the back.  You’ll be carrying a “Account Executive” and “Sales Professional” and some other “semi-sales” individuals that make up what they call an “Account team”.  However, seldom will any of those individuals say anything in a meeting other than to introduce themselves and say how they don’t know anything about the technology before passing the buck to the technical seller to run the show and all the follow-up.  Your account team will make double what you make and work about ¼ as hard as you do.  To make matters worse, 50% of your variable compensation will be at the discretion of your manager (no way shape or form dependent on your sales performance.)  One of many problems with this is the turnover rate of managers in the organization.  Microsoft has a very high turnover on their leadership teams (whether its new talent, RIF, change in business etc.)   I’ve had 8 managers in 5 years.  When it comes time to do our ranks (yes they do stack rankings behind closed doors despite what they will ever admit to) if you have a new manager or someone who isn’t networked well, you will likely get a low rating and low end of year payout.  What this means, is that as a technical seller while you are supposed to be more insulated from variability in compensation, this model does the complete opposite.  You’ll have huge swings in your pay from one year to another depending on who your manager is.  In fact, as I write this, I’ve had a $43K swing in my pay (unfortunately down) all within a year where I was one of Microsoft’s top performers (even nominated for club.)  Do yourself a favor, if you want to do technical sales, do not do it at Microsoft or look for a job title as a “SSP – Solution Sales Professional” or “AE – Account Executive” where you can make twice as much, have less variability/risk in your pay, and work far less hours with way better work life balance.",2.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,3.0

Working for them cured that fondness, completely. The company is made up mostly of two kinds of people. Those that have been there forever and are expert at dodging responsibility and those that get used by those people. If you are a white male, run the other way as fast as you can. Microsoft is actively trying to 'cleanse' the company of white males. If you are not a white male you are 'diversity hire'... and they have goals to dramatically increase those. They wont say they are hoping to get rid of white males, but it's an inverse of myopically focusing on retaining everyone else. I've never met a more dishonest culture inside a company. The place is rife with two faced fake people. Sure there are some good people. But overwhelmingly the leadership is very veiled and sneaky. Prone to making abrupt and ill-informed decisions; which they can ultimately hide from the repercussions of or skillfully blame it on others. 
They seem to churn &amp; burn a lot of people. This is probably a result of their bigger initiative to get rid of white men. But they also go out of their way to hire people that come from different backgrounds and then they try to pound them into being like everyone else at Microsoft. They literally sought me out for help, then told me how to do things. It's no wonder why Amazon is so much better at doing things than they are. They clamor to listen to Satya, which is ironic that his reports and ultimately the way the company runs is nothing like anything he says.

There isn't really a ""management culture"" here unlike other big/mature companies I've worked at.   Some managers are promoted for being a good IC which means managing up and not being interested in coaching.  It's very subjective what makes a top performer and varies by group.  They're changing the review process but its still opaque. 
Big company with lots of politics.  Sometimes it feels like you're working in the government and not in the fast paced tech sector.  Different groups will start similar projects, then senior managers lobby for each one and there's very little assurance that anything you create or run will continue into the next fiscal year (especially if there's a reorg).

At times, the work you do is not easy to connect to actual value and it is hard to justify the time and effort spent on it. Work/life balance at upper management is hardly existent.

The vast majority of employees now feel proud to work for Microsoft compared to the Ballmer era.  Microsoft has great benefits (PTO, 401k match, new caregiver benefit, reimbursement for up to $800 in physical fitness, etc.) and flexible work arrangements.   Work can be very rewarding and you have the ability to make a real impact on the world.  The yearly MSReady conference in Las Vegas for field roles is quite fun with lots of opportunities to learn and a great way to recharge.  Many friendly, intelligent, and hard-working people work at Microsoft.  You'll learn a great deal.","Limited Career Advancement Opportunities For Some People- 
If you don't live in WA state or nearby one of Microsoft's campuses, career advancement  is very tough unless you want to stay in a sales-oriented or 90%-travel position.   

Difficult and Time Consuming to Move Around in the Company:
The internal interview process to move into a new role or organization within the company is very slow (can take weeks or months), not at all transparent, and is a full-day interview experience just as external candidates have to face.  Competition is fierce but if you're persistent it's possible to land a new position.

Tools &amp; Processes:
Employees continually have low marks on yearly polling regarding having the right tools, reports, and processes in place to get our jobs done effectively.  I haven't seen many improvements in the several years I've been here and don't expect many changes in the future either.

There are frustrations there like anywhere else, but I always got the feeling that if you put some  effort into it, you could have a great career. And the different teams offer different cultures, so you can move around inside the company and  really keep the excitement going.
The people you work with are brilliant for the most part, and that is  definitely something I'll miss. Other companies have brilliant people too, I'm just saying that  most people at Microsoft I interacted with were really smart and it was great.
Most projects I worked on in Windows were really exciting, and touched the lives of millions of users. That's not something you get in all companies for sure.
Work-life balance is really good. I would say you  can control it: more hours will get you a better career, and that makes sense. Fewer hours  means less progression, but as long as you're doing a good job and meeting your  goals, you'll be  fine.

Most employees are eager to help others when asked and also have a ton of knowledge to share.
Reviews are leaner with the Connect process.  If you are lucky enough to have a good people manager, you should look to have a Connect every 2-3 months, which is great for helping to keep you on track and give you more accurate measurements of impact.
Azure is taking off and the focus is moving entirely to an engineering/developer mindset, leveraging Site Reliability Engineering (SRE).  The more you deliver that has direct impact the more you will be rewarded.","The Ying to the Yang is that while Connects are good, they are also limited to the discretion of the manager.  You will likely get at least 2 Connects a year based on organizational pressure to management; however, in some cases that is not always the case.  Even if you can represent significant impact in Connects, you are again at the discretion of the manager.  You manager can completely disagree and provide negative feedback and there is not much you can do about it other than to move internally to another team or organization to avoid a bad situation.
If you are an employee in operations, IT, or other service engineering discipline, you will need to know coding and deliver code.  This is where things are going.  If you cannot adjust to this new skill set and deliver against it, then you are going to be in a bad place.

It's so bad that there's actually a term for meaningful work to distinguish it from normal daily tasks: ""Impact"".  You're ""making an impact"" if you manage to actually do something that will improve customers' experiences or make other engineers actually more productive rather than waste more of their time.  FYI, at most companies I've worked with, ""Impact"" is the standard and a lack of impact results in termination of the employee, team, or the entire company itself.

Microsoft under Satya Nadella is paying lip service to the philosophy that made Microsoft great in the first place and has been serving other companies so well recently, but in practice the company is a bloated, ineffectual behemoth of failure.  Most of the people who brought the tech industry to its knees in the 80s and 90s got rich and got out, and they trained a generation of quiet, useless busybodies to replace themselves.  Anyone with any passion or dedication to quality got slowly extruded out the back end of the company over the last 20 years, until we got to this point where Microsoft abandons+reboots their failed phone platform every two years and makes laughably terrible moves like removing the Start Button and forcing updates on people mid-presentation.",4.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

- There are some fun products / franchises to work on","- In some departments, a constant 50-60 hours/week with no extra compensation is silently expected on top of strict core hours.  Only want to work 40 hours/week?  Expect to fall behind and be replaced by someone willing to do 50-60.
- Want to take a vacation?  Good luck finding someone to cover your work.  During a 40 hour period, I had to do 60 hours week before and 60 hours week after a 1-week vacation to stay caught up, and still had to use my vacation days.  Can't trade OT for time off.
- Depending on manager, feedback on performance may be good (early, actionable) or bad (too late, in-actionable).
- Mid-to-upper management is all about coming up with fancy-sounding ideas and initiatives full of buzzwords that everyone else is forced to follow, but in reality these ""initiatives"" tend to be poorly thought-out, huge time wasters, and are obviously only there to pad management's commitments so they get good reviews and bonuses
- Lots of office politics.  In many cases, advancement/bonuses/etc. are all about ""looking good"" to the right people, not actually being good at your job
- Constantly pushing good ICs to become mediocre managers instead of letting them become *great* ICs.  This results in ICs that are great at knowing one tech / area / etc. being forced to own multiple areas at a much lower level of fluency and be less effective.
- Microsoft as a whole feels relatively clueless about making new products that customers actually want.  Windows Phone is just one example of how Microsoft can totally shoot themselves in the foot, Skype hasn't had a major update in years and is losing ground to fast-moving newcomers, etc.  Depending on what you work on, there's a chance that it simply won't matter or exist in the next few years, which is frustrating.",2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,2.0

Schedules are pretty flexible, but there is an unspoken rule/expectation to 'be online' to make up any time taken.  Work life balance is a Microsoft value.  And for the most part there is no problems taking time when you need it.  Plus there is a work from home availability.","There is too much management and it is top down management.  It is a constant energy suck to prove your value, why you are necessary to your job.  The need to do your day job at night is constant.  There are so many meetings and so much political games that morale is low.  If you are not a buddy with LT, you get a lot of crap thrown over the fence to you and I constantly fight to maintain my job ownership.   

People get promoted for very little (even being gone on parental leave for 6 months of the year!) and folks get promised a promo and don't get one.  And I cannot say enough to paint the appropriate picture of the review process here.  It is abysmal.  It takes hours to write and usually happens after your rewards for the year is already set.  And your rewards are not based on what you accomplished.  It is people's perspective of the value.  I have had a manager tell me I have not delivered anything in a year because my skip level doesn't see anything I deliver and isn't aware of its impact.  Yet my job is to keep things running smoothly so they don't receive any escalations.  Again, it isn't what you do in your job, it is what you did in addition to your job and how loud you showcase it.

While there are opportunities here, it is extremely time consuming to transition somewhere else.  If, stress the IF, you get an informational to discuss the job opening, it is even rarer that you get selected for the interview loop.  There is a common saying here, it is easier to leave Microsoft and come back then it is to transfer internally. 

While it is also a Pro, the benefits at MS are not what they used to be.  Pay is similar now to lots of companies.  And a lot of the pay is rolled up in your annual review, which includes a bonus and stock.  the bonus is below average and the stock only vests 1/5 a year.  So while your stock is part of your 'raise' you don't get any until 6 months to a year later.  And if you leave MS, you lose it.  So it is really a Con.  Healthcare is good but no longer free.  Employees have to pay out of pocket now based on HSAs and are taxed on employer paid portions.  It is viewed as a cost containment not a benefit anymore.    I hear from old colleagues they get better pay and benefits when leaving MS.  They felt undervalued here and when they leave they receive large bumps in pay and equivalent levels.

Satya is a good leader who is genuinely trying to change the company for the better.","Its a big ship that takes a long time to turn, so many of the old mindsets are still highly prevalent in the organization.  The key ones are:
1) Arrogance: Yes, there are bright people here, but sadly people tend to believe their own press too much. 
2) Lack of customer centricity:  Linked to #1, people believe they know more than customer do. Frankly, customer is a concept on a ppt slide. Part of the problem is that all global roles are a) based in Redmond b) rarely leave Redmond c) not directly linked to the field where the work actually happens d) spend their time building playbooks and strategy videos NO ONE actually reads or cares about. 
3) Linking words with action: the follow-through is non-existent. You sit in a meeting and the person will say, I will drive that and come back. They rarely do. Its such a large company and globally you are disconnected from the business in many groups so the accountability is not there.
4) Leadership gaps: Leaders tend to be very isolated, at the CVP and GM levels, you engage them through their business managers who filter information to them.   Most leaders also are more focused on making partner than developing their teams, sadly. 
5) You have to be in the Enterprise side, the consumer side is a trainwreck, led by people who have no clue what they are doing. Its also not a focus (outside of Office) for Satya. If you are a strong retail person, you will quickly see many serious challenges. 

Satya is driving change and its the right change, but the challenge is that while he has replaced many of the Senior Leaders who didn't buy into his game plan, the next level of management (GM) is still firmly entrenched in the ways of the past so will take a long time to make Microsoft a customer-centric, people-focused, agile organization and by that time, the market will have already moved on.",4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0

Basically, hiring teams don't really get to see you in order to evaluate your qualification unless they have a req for a college hire. This means that you as a candidate have less opportunities since you are pushed into a smaller set of job-opening (and auto-rejected from industry-hire category), and you as a hiring team are being excluded from considering candidates that are technically qualified.

Not quite up to par as far as smaller, scrappy companies. Too many PMs running around trying to ""add value"" while a lot just scrape by doing the minimum. It's easy to step on toes if you want to make an impact, and it's annoying to watch others just coasting and getting the same salary.
Similar to the PM group, Dev and QA folks can be really hit or miss.
Accountability is something that seems to be lacking. KPIs are rarely tracked after a product ships, and any mishaps are just hushed.

Marketing for enterprise business solutions is very weak, mostly focused on collateral with corporate banalities that have little value.

There have been more than a few layoffs (wrapped into ""re-orgs"") in recent years and the practice of stack ranking employees has continued, although mgmt attempted to obscure this by calling it something else (b/c of the negative press following the Vanity Fair article about 5yrs ago).  

For years now it seems that numbers have been set at unattainable levels so that most don't make their numbers. This started during the K.T. era (former COO), presumably to cut payout costs, but it has continued after his departure. If I recall, it started after the company announced an across the board raise in base salaries (apparently in response to 'employee feedback about too much compensation being tied to stock'). 

From that point growth targets seemed to get crazy and a lot of good people left. You'd have one good year but 2 bad ones. Mgmt might change quota or revenue recognition rules mid year and there's nothing you can do about it; or worse yet, you may not find out there was a rule change until the end of the fiscal when you're trying to figure out why your attainment number is off. Incentive plans are so complex that you need a PhD to comprehend.

You have the same VPs running teams there and they continue to perpetuate favoritism and sexism. There is no safety at Microsoft. You may be okay in a role for a while, until there is a re-org. A new VP comes in and replaces all the leadership with people they know. That job you were waiting around for? Gone. It's given to someone the VP trusts.

Culture is also about how we treat each other. Office politics happen when there is a lack of trust in the workplace. Teams are still competing with the each other for resources. Within teams, managers are playing games to protect their own feature areas and resources. With respect to compensation, it gets worse. While MSFT can say they got rid of the stack rank, it's the same budget for rewards. It's not possible to give everyone a max payout with the budget.
