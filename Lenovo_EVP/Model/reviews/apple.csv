Overall, Apple Retail has some high highs and low lows. I tried to document my experience as well as possible, and honestly ended up writing much more than I had originally intended. I do want to add the disclaimer that although there is a big block of text in the ""CONS"" section, I did enjoy working at Apple. I liked my job there, paid me well and I got valuable experience. Was it something I'd do as a career? No. Was it a good stepping stone in my professional development? Absolutely. I write this feedback not to slander Apple but to give a genuine account of my experience, prepare others who are considering joining Apple, and hopefully help Apple Retail improve for the sake of all Apple employees. 

At Apple, I had the privilege of meeting people with all kinds of different backgrounds, education levels, and experiences. Even now that I have moved on, several of my mentors at Apple continue to push me to improve. I can genuinely say that Apple was the most diverse company I have ever worked for, and yet it wasn’t a gimmick or to fill a quota. It felt like you could be your genuine self and I would say that I felt very welcome there. 

I experienced a tremendous amount of personal and professional growth during my time there. If you had asked me before I started, I would never have described myself as a leader and yet by the end of my time at Apple, I had led initiatives, coached/mentored my peers, and established myself as a leader, resource, and mentor. I learned how to talk about myself and the work I’m doing in a concise way (STAR / SBO). I learned how to collaborate with people with different work styles from my own, how to provide feedback in different ways based on how the person best receives it, and I learned how to challenge and be challenged without damaging my relationship with my colleagues. I learned a lot about my own worth as an employee and how to advocate for myself. I learned to seek to understand, to approach mistakes as opportunity for shared growth rather than an opportunity to place blame, and how to be empathetic even when it is easy not to be. 

Some of the best managers I’ve ever had were from Apple. These managers were not afraid to jump into the fray when we were at our busiest. They empowered my colleagues and I to make the call in a tough situation and backed us up on whatever we felt was best. They trusted us to do our jobs well and always sought to understand before giving feedback or calling out problems if they arose. They went to bat for us against managers who were quick to dismiss our talents.","For context, I was one of the top repair technicians and consistently rated within the top 3 in the store for repair quality and timeliness from the time I received my ACiT (Apple Certified iPhone Technician) certification. I passed my ACMT (Apple Certified Mac Technician) certification with a 97% (68 questions correct out of 70). In addition, I have prior experience building computers and have a solid grasp on how computers work / what hardware components do. 

No repercussions for calling off so it wasn’t uncommon for 5-6 people to call off a day.

At the Genius Bar, they consistently prioritized personality types over technical skill when considering candidates. Storewide, great candidates were consistently passed over in favor of more vocal candidates. It was also not uncommon for managers to play favorites, and some managers would actually do their best to undermine your development if they didn’t like you.

I believe that while skills can be taught, attitude is a key point of your personality and is not so easily changed. However, for this model of hiring the person, not the skill, there needs to be sufficient training to get the person up to a functional standpoint. I would say Apple has done a lackluster job when it comes to technician training the past few years. Genius (Mac technician) training consists of two weeks off the sales floor doing self-guided online trainings (few of which that actually apply to the service being provided), a certification assessment, and a week of repair shadowing. After that point, the new Genius can do their first repair ON A CUSTOMER'S MACHINE. Customers pay a lot of money for the products and a lot of money for repairs. It is absolutely unacceptable that the first computer a technician takes apart is a paying customer's machine. In addition, nearly all of the other Geniuses had no computer experience outside the Genius Bar. The troubleshooting process for most of my former peers is just pattern matching reported symptoms with support guides and regurgitating solutions. 

Despite being the youngest Genius on my team and the least tenured in the role, I regularly had to fix the mistakes of my peers. Some examples of repair mistakes include putting screws in the wrong location, not plugging in antenna / mic / camera / battery connectors before marking a repair as ready for customer pickup, not taking security precautions when dealing with batteries, leaving ESD sensitive components sitting out uncovered for hours at a time, bending a pin on a logic board, and more. I also had to reset customer expectations after one of my peers advised a customer that her new iMac wouldn’t run any faster than her 2013 iMac because they both had HDDs. The issue the customer was experiencing was no more related to the HDD than Java is related to Javascript (read: not related at all). In the end, I was able to fix the issue but the customer had clearly lost faith in the Genius Bar and honestly, I can’t blame her for that. 

The biggest issue though, in my opinion, was the inconsistency in management. The managers were either amazing or the worst, no in between. See my experience with the good ones in the “Pros” section. The bad managers, though, were awful. Micromanagement, lack of trust, and blatant favoritism were common. These managers clearly prioritized the customer in the store rather than the customer with a device awaiting repair. Mac repair consisted of 1-3 technicians (normally 1 on weekdays, 2 on fri/sat, 3 for special occasions), occurred only once per day for 2-3 hours maximum (normally 2), and yet at least one Mac technician was pulled to the floor early on a nearly daily basis causing a never-ending cycle of late repairs and angry customers. 

The store leader was the worst, in my opinion. They had no knowledge of Genius Bar processes yet frequently made (impossible) requests of the technicians. Example: a customer came in with a device with no accessible device identifier (missing SIM tray = no IMEI, would not turn on so no S/N, and the serial reader tool didn’t retrieve anything from the phone). The customer was advised that ideally the SIM tray would be needed or at minimum a proof of purchase to service the device as the internal ticketing system was tied to the device identifier (SN) and there was no way to create a repair / replacement for the device without it, even as a customer service exception. The customer started to escalate and get visibly upset, so the store leader got involved and after being informed of the situation, advised the technician to just replace the phone (a common exception when a customer is escalated). Except that there was no possible way to systematically replace the phone. Even if the technician took a phone off the shelf and gave it to the customer, there would still be a litany of issues preventing the customer from using the replacement. This is only one of countless examples.",5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0

Health insurance is top tier with nominal premiums.
RSUs, ESPP, EPP+, discounts on cell services, discounts with retailers and lots of other perks. 
Gym reimbursement if you don’t work on any of the campuses, bike reimbursement, or pays for commuter services.
The company is there for their employees during natural disasters, etc. 
Free legal advice if you’re going through matters outside of work.
Free therapy sessions if needed throughout the year.  
So many free or highly discounted services and products provided to us. 

In addition, the amount of opportunity for growth to corporate is unparalleled. If you leverage a career experience or mentor ship well enough, there’s no way you won’t open doors to corporate. (from a retail level)","At the retail level, it’s turned into a “good old boy” hierarchy. Market team leaders being brought in from clothing or big box retailers, hiring all their old buddies as lower leadership. It’s how our retail culture is being lost. Positive intent only thrives within employees that are considered “legacy” thinkers.  And “legacy” thinkers don’t get promoted. Work/Life balance does not exist within Apple Retail, even for part timers. 

At the corporate level, it’s a scramble to fill positions. So we’ve hired so many people that aren’t top tier talent anymore. Friends hiring friends for the sake of friendship, instead of how they can actually perform.  Pay is also not as competitive as other companies in SF/Bay Area/San Jose. 

They don’t like hiring from within for management positions.  There are some really great employees and people that I worked with that should’ve been management a long time ago, but they’re quickly passed over.",1.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,1.0

Lots of classic Apple, feel good, cult vibe. Company mission is lofty. Relatively flat managerial hierarchy means you can approach anyone on the floor for help without getting an ""That's not my job"" or ""I'm too important to ask"" attitude. The majority of my co-workers were friendly and helpful. Again, very little attitude towards new people. Met some interesting and friendly folks.

25% discount for you. 10% discount for friends and family.

After all the rah rah APPLE IS GREAT dies down it is a sales job. For the most part Apple products sell themselves. Most people tend to know what they want. They come to the store for the Apple experience. After that you're being judged on stuff like adding AppleCare+, Apple Business introductions and other metrics. 

Training feels rushed. 3 weeks of partial drilling of sales highlights. Too much to know for the incredibly complicated world of products, cell phone plans, AppleCare+ and Genius Bar. Basically they pound you full of the overview and you'll pick up the rest on the floor. 

Seasonal workers are exposed to the benefits and perks of the full time employees but can't participate. Feels bad. You get some of the benefits but not others and it is often not clear.

Had more experienced staff snipe business referrals from customers I was working with.

I had one interaction with my team leader in 4 months. Nice guy but felt very uninterested in our team growth.  I'd be curious to see what the retention was per team related to the team leaders.

Had coworkers tell me they avoided taking customers who appeared to be from abroad due to the likelihood that they wouldn't be able to attach AppleCare+ to a sale and drive down their numbers. Managers seem to be oblivious to that fact.

Constant drumbeat for retail employees to care and give back to the community with employee donations and volunteering. Asking people making  $25k a year to donate and volunteer for things felt weird. While they are all very earnest and good causes, they should be teaching financial planning seminars more often. The amount of coworkers spending their paychecks back into Apple was astounding.

Seasonal workers are expected to put in time on their own development despite not having access to the tools the full time staff have. It is unclear when you're supposed to put in this time as your work week if fully scheduled.",3.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,3.0

- Potentially the most stress free job ever.","- You don’t actually have to work. For this role, there is no way of tracking productivity. So people who actually do work and people who sit around loafing all day are essentially the same. 

- No deadlines, deliverables or goals. So you will just feel like you’re wasting time. 

- Only 12 sick days a year. And you have to earn them on an hourly, per pay check basis. 

- This is an hourly role. So you’ll be treated like a child. You’ll be told exactly when to take your lunch and breaks. Even though the job is pretty much online and should allow for more flexibility. Also they will make it very evident that they don’t trust you with organization secrets. Apple in general is very paranoid. 

- Archaic practices. This job is literally online. It can be done from literally anywhere and any communication required could be done online. However, there are no options to work from home, or even an open workspace at the office. You will not be given a laptop. You will have a desktop and will have to work from an uncomfortable desk. Management is not  open to the flexibilities of this day and age.   

- They’ll tell you they want feedback, but they really don’t. 

- Communication is very manual. Managers will literally go around to every one or yell for everyone to gather for a meeting, instead of using all the technology available to us. This is really just funny to watch.

Good job for dimwitted people. Even managers would give one-off plain robotic corporate responses to meetings or questions. It's like everyone has one single functioning brain cell. They don't divulge personal life or do anything interesting with their life in general. Repeat the same stale processes or answer technical questions over and over. Customers come in thinking they can yell at you to get what they want. Or they think they know your job better. Management has nothing better to do than hover over their subordinates and nitpick/lord it over. Type A personalities that love to stick it to you if you do anything wrong in their eyes. You can't disagree from their collective opinions. You're being watched all the time. They espouse that ""we're all family"" and constantly repeat the desired belief in the cultish ""Apple values"" a la carte quotes every-major-company-ever uses to lure in its employees' brand loyalty. Pay is terrible considering it's a multi-billion dollar company. Zero work life balance. They'd rather you make them your #1 priority over school, family, and home.  Apple is a shady company exactly like everyone else. Just with more profit off the brainless public. If they have to repeatedly insist they are ""different"" and that ""they're family"" they're saying oxymorons. No upward movement.

439,"""Creative Pro - Greater Boston""",I worked at Apple ,"-Excellent benefits like stock plans, tuition reimbursement, discounts inside and outside Apple, health coverage for everyone (including part time). Also free health screenings and flu shot sessions once a year.

-Somewhat flexible with school schedules. 

-You make supportive and smart friends at Apple that last, who may move on to better corporate roles or other tech companies. Also great to hang out with, if work friends are your thing.

-Your career is centered around growth and development, being the best at your role. Even if you’re not staying long-term, you grow and learn a lot.

-Managers who started as non-management genuinely care about you. Market Leaders are generally visible and charismatic. They visit each store in their market at least once a week, sometimes twice.

-Occasional (once every two years or so) town hall with Apple executives, usually on topics of people, retail, diversity and inclusion. If Tim Cook is in town, he makes an effort to visit the nearest store. When he was in Boston for a speech at MIT, he stopped at Apple Boylston Street and took several employees to a Red Sox game where he briefly spoke.","-Consistently seemingly too many, lofty, high stress targets every quarter that have to be met or even exceeded or else you won’t see any career progression at Apple. 

-Besides occasional flowery lip service from corporate and some retail managers, Today at Apple is not advocated for at all on any level - as a creative or creative pro Today at Apple are the sessions you facilitate. You will spend 85% of your time pitching Today at Apple to customers and/or selling accessories and services.

-Very little of your time is spent facilitating or preparing for sessions. And, because of this lack of advocacy, managers will always be questioning how you’re spending your time is common. They won’t trust you. It’s also common to be flexed from your duties to do *more important* things like sales. 

-You will frequently not have the proper equipment or working technology to facilitate seamless sessions. Due to the lack of advocacy, you will have Genius Bar and sales associates working with customers at your table or in the forum as you’re facilitating sessions. This will significantly negatively impact your ratings from customers.

-Your ratings and ultimately your compensation are directly influenced by the number of attendees you have in session, as well as their ratings of you. Anything but a 5/5 at Apple is considered bad. This rating system applies to all roles in Apple Retail.

-As of late (~5 years), Apple has been progressively hiring more and more big box managers from companies like Walmart, Best Buy, Target, and district managers from other random places like Gap, Starbucks, or Lord + Taylor. While they have volume experience necessary for Apple, they bring the same bad people habits and lack of creativity with them. These types of managers are colloquially referred to as the big box robots or “yes men”. Internally developed/promoted managers have always performed and led better, long-term.

-No long-term leave options for students like many other retail/service companies. Also, there’s absolutely no work/life balance. Tuition reimbursement criteria hard to achieve while working 32-45hrs/week.",1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0

441,"""AHA College Advisor""",I have been working at Apple part-time for less than a year,"Convenient, they sent me a computer, sent me everything to get started and you plan your work schedule before each semester so it does not interfere with your classes. 20 hours a week. $16/hour in my market. Paid biweekly, overtime available, have worked multiple 105 hour two week periods ($1100-1200 after tax and 10% to Employee stock plan and 6% to IRA contributions; I have another health plan so this is without any health benefits taken out). Full health benefits (You're still paying a chunk out of your paycheck but it is available).

You get $500 off iPad, iPhone, or Mac after 3 months working there or lower amount off a less costly item.","GETS OLD QUICK. Job is not engaging. This is a workhorse position. You are not viewed as a person, your are viewed as statistic. I have 95% customer satisfaction over last 6 months, yet, if a customer is upset because they either locked themselves out of their device and have to wait or purchased a device off of Ebay and you have to explain to them that they got scammed, your manager will never take your side; they will always find a way to make the customer correct even if the customer is crazy. Managers constantly change so you never create a rapport before getting a new one that treats you as another number. There is no mobility between departments outside of AppleCare; I am a finance major and was hoping this would be a way to get my foot in the door of the finance department, however, there is only mobility in AppleCare. They would rather move you from T1 to T2 advisor than advise you to take a Financial Advising job at Morgan Stanley. 

If you keep your equipment, it's written off as a ""Benefit of Kind"" on their balance sheet so something to consider with the $4000 computer.

You are not paid off of performance, you are paid Cost of Labor for your position in your specific market. People in rich areas get paid more than people in poor areas even though they are doing the same job.

Apple tuition assistance only pays for courses related to your job as a T1 advisor so good luck using it on anything other than a tech field.

T2s are rude and most T1s are idiots.

They automatically assign you Full Time Shifts of 8 hours 5/7 days per week during Christmas and other holidays without asking you what works best for you whether it be hours or days.

Apple constantly changes protocols such as how ""How you should answer the phone"" and then ""Now you can't say this when you answer"" and it happens so often that when your calls get reviewed by a third party service, you will get failed on a call because a third party service knows the updated rules better than an employee.

—Highly political culture.  Very siloed. GSM and Capex community is particularly difficult to work with.  Some PD groups are legendary for being difficult to work with.
—turnover is high.
—People are highly educated, but sometimes don’t possess good engineering common sense.  Endless funding and a faux accountability structure insulates people with amazing pedigrees but poor engineering judgement.

You basically have to live and breathe it at every moment, on the clock or off. Forced overtime during releases or holidays. Passive aggressive management techniques designed to make you feel guilty for missing work. Revolving door of employees because of nearly unobtainable requirements set by management. Training had a lot of bumps in it, not because of the trainers, but the lack of material. I mentioned holidays before. You might as well forget seeing your family if you have to travel. No time off is allowed during the winter holidays. Zero, none, even if you have planned a year in advance. Overtime is often forced even during the weeks with holidays so you have even less time off for your families. When you express any concern over these practices the management takes you aside to remind you that only the customer is important and that you agreed to work any times the office was open. Speaking of time away from family, if you get assigned to a special project prepare to work 60+hours a week. Management becomes aggressive when you aren't performing to specific standards and this can sometimes lead to 20-25% turnover in a given month. In fact, less than 5% of my starting group lasted more than 90 days. Busy work is given almost daily, which interferes with work operations. Any new training is given via these ridiculous online courses or through a very brief summery in an online meeting (Webex). Worst of all, sometimes it is given out via email with little explanation of policy changes. Attendance is always an issue and with little wiggle room, no manner your tenure.

I guess the best summary is they put product and capitol far above their employees worth, like most businesses, but without a real pretense of caring. Low pay, long hours just to have Apple on your resume probably isn't worth it since most companies of the caliber pay more with better incentives.

If you are a specialist, your manager is just there to enforce the rules and policies. They are not there to guide you along your journey at Apple or the organization.

Not all managers are people people. The rules are mean to be followed and not meant to be bend, even for the greater good. You will be among followers, not leaders. (Apple has succeeded because they break the rules and don't just follow.)

You will be micromanaged on your work. This may be refuted by those in management, but its is accurate. The entire place is micromanaged ""up the wazoo"".

The business always comes first. Always. ""Business needs"" are the reason for everything. Of course the business is important, but some seem to forget how the business needs actually get fulfilled and by whom.

They pride themselves on culture but I never saw it, and managers were never friendly or empathic with me on my personal needs or my medical needs. I told them before my firing that this would really be rock bottom for me and that is kill myself. When they fired me in a webcam session I honestly considered it, and with 2 managers on camera pulled my gun out cocked it and put it to my head on camera. They didn't respond or do anything before I told them I need to leave and shut down my computer. I dare anyone at Apple to pull that session since I know it's recorded, but that's who you're dealing with

You'll be screwed time and again on your schedule so just get used to that. 4 years I was there, never once did I get the schedule I wanted or anything close to it.

Don’t trust HR. Employees don’t realize that HR has a legal obligation to Apple and it’s stakeholders to protect the company and side with the company on employee issues. They are NOT looking out of the employee’s best interest. That is not their job, but they would like you to think they are. Do not confide any confidential information with. They will turn on you and defend Apple rather than admit wrong doing by the company and risk a lawsuit from an employee. I’ve seen many employees forced out of the company because HR turned on them and they became a liability.

Rude, unprofessional and unethical work culture. Senior leadership within IS&amp;T are terrible, egoistic megalomaniac, with zero leadership skills. They don't know how to lead by example.
- There is no place for engineers here in this group. Rampant politics and horrible work culture. Managers in this group are nothing but ""project managers"", who have no technical / engineering acumen, and have no eye towards architecture, code or good engineering practices. They treat engineers like second class citizens. These managers have no interest in career growth and development of their employees. All they care about is themselves and their RSU refreshers, appeasing their bosses anyway possible to get there.
- Most of the teams in IS&amp;T build internal and corporate tools/applications. and they are dismal at that, from infrastructure to development processes, terrible..terrible !! You won't be working on anything world changing. 
- If you think you can change groups easily, you are sadly mistaken. It is very difficult to change groups/departments within Apple. You need to let your manager of your interest first, then go through the entire recruitment process, as if you are an external candidate, and if for whatever reason, you do not end up landing that new position, you would face extreme retaliation in your current team, your current manager would screw your career up. You would be ostracized, and he/she would make sure you have no future left in Apple. 
- IS&amp;T has a bad reputation within apple, and every other group within apple treats IS&amp;T folks that way. Other engineering groups are treated better. In short, apple has this subtle class-based culture. Not everyone is treated equally and respect.

If you are an engineer and thinking about joining Apple and IS&amp;T assuming you would be able to do amazing engineering work, you are sadly mistaken. IS&amp;T is the place where engineers come to destroy their career. My personal advice - Stay away from this group.",2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0

1431,"""Not Sustainable - You feel disposable and used""",I worked at Apple full-time for less than a year,"You get to work at ""Apple"". Whatever that means to you. To me it meant nothing.","It is a high stress job involving travel to China. Since Apple products are assembled in China, thats where most of the action happens from a Supply Chain and Operations perspective. My days started early with calls with teams in Europe. During the day i was working with teams in US. From evening until night, I was on calls with teams in China as you get a lot of requests. It was a 24x7 thankless job. If you have time to manage two projects, you'll always have four. You are not innovating or designing cool products in Supply Chain. You are only making sure these products are ready when customers want it. The only differentiator in performance is the number of hours you put in. 
1. There are not many people with great backgrounds here. Most of the folks are from supply chain backgrounds from random less reputed companies or business schools for whom having Apple on the CV is a huge uplift. Some people with good background are at senior positions who joined Apple in the early days and they are enjoying their million dollar valuation of stocks.
2. Leadership: Apple loves engineers. Most people in managerial roles got promoted from IC engineering roles and do not have an iota of aura or leadership qualities. They are very arrogant and don't care about people.
3. The work is very stressful with aggressive targets and you have to always be on top of China. I have seen people break down in meetings. Many people had health issues and were always looking to exit. Having alcohol on your table is common. There is no time for personal life. When you join you are given a paper that says 'the work you will do is so great that people dont mind spending their weekends here'. Thats a hint. LOL
4. Average employee turnover time is ten months. It is just not sustainable and that is why you can always find tons of open GSM roles on the Apple website. Apple is now a big organization and it is tough to move up and steer the politics.  
5. Culture: There is no culture. Every person is on his/her own. There is no collaboration. No one likes to share anything and people keep fighting to prove their point. You'll be doing everything yourself from scratch everytime and that will add to the hours and frustration. In my team, people fought for air time and tried to make loud conversations with team mates when manager was around. It was fake environment. The director would come to happy hour in team area for two minutes and take a mental head count of who all were present and who all were not participating in this 'team event'.  
6. Even with Apple salary, you'll just make your ends meet as this is one of the most expensive part of the world. You will never be able to afford to buy a house. You'll shell out all your money on rent and survival stuff. 
7. Career Opportunities: Depends on your relations. However every project is secretive and that limits your opportunities. Also, you can only move within your vertical. Moving to Applecare is not possible. Also, my manager dint help me in any way to find a new role when i wanted to change roles. Thats common. Also, you'll be hired because you can do the job well. Apple will not invest in your to develop new skills. You'll be doing the same work your entire life. 

In short working at Apple involves high stress, all your hours, no new skills development and little savings. The only thing you get is an Apple name on your CV. Is it worth it? You decide for yourself. International folks with MBA, this role is a trap and its tough to get out. There are better options out there.

- groups within the same org can function 110% different ranging from the 9-5 group to the laid back results oriented group.
- politics and stereotypes internally abound. Was “let go” after a lengthy investigation on a violation of a policy enacted 2 years after I was hired. No psa of new zero tolerance policies, or so they said. 
- certain orgs acquire agencies and they bring that dynamic with them. Most of the time they’re siloed which is good but if you’ve been part of an agency you probably don’t want that culture in your day to day anymore
- if you want benefits (snacks, stocked fridge) , salary at the higher end of the scale and have an impact on what you’re contributing as a designer, this might not be the place for you.

Allowed for some individuality - both in wardrobe expression and daily operations.,"Dealing with customers is certainly a part of retail, but we get a lot of heat from customers from decisions that corporate makes. And then, most of the time, we give the customer what they want anyways. Not to say that's wrong, but it messes with the standards and adds to the ""other Apple Store does it"" argument.
Additionally, as a part time employee hours can range from 15-30 hours per week - at least that's what the paperwork says. I was getting scheduled for about 28 hours a week consistently while also in college. This was fine until I realized that my academics were suffering, so I went to my managers and asked to reduce my hours. I was denied that because ""there aren't enough people...we need you...we have to have everyone on deck for Saturdays and Sundays"". That's certainly fair, but I didn't believe it when I saw leave requests getting approved left and right and continuous callouts throughout the whole section going unstopped.
My biggest gripe was the lack of scheduling flexibility.
I heard that there was room to grow and experiment with different jobs, but never got to experience that as I eventually ended up having to quit after a long attempt to reduce hours.
When I started not ""meeting standards"" for my position, I asked to move to a different section.

The training leaves you well-prepared for the world of customer service, and you will enjoy interacting with your customers everyday. It will rarely feel like retail and you'll become part of a big family. Apple is very team-oriented and they care about your personal development. There are a lot of opportunities and challenges you will face to help your growth within the company.

1904,"""WWDR IOS APP REVIEW - AVOID""",I worked at Apple full-time for more than 3 years,"iOS App Review is under the Marketing umbrella - which arguably throws some of the best parties. Unfortunately, you can't bring +1s, and they're increasingly segmenting this team away from the main events. Last party I attended, Marketing threw a holiday party for their team - and then they threw a second one that App Review was invited to. Reminds me of segregation. Not all Apple employees are created equal.

Healthcare is good - for now. Wouldn't be surprised if these full-time hourly roles eventually become contracted positions.

If you like to punch in on time - exactly on time, no more than 10-15 minutes earlier, definitely no more than 10-15 minutes later or you get written up - sit at your desk, pretend to be invisible to stay out of the drama, do your work with your head down, and then punch back out - this is exactly the right job for you.","I knew within 4 months I was going to be unhappy at WWDR. The shifts are strict. The management, with the exception of one or two, sucks. No free food. Rare team events that continue to dwindle in number over time. Lots of internal drama and power struggle. The rest of Apple looks down on you as not truly being a part of Apple. There's no visibility with anyone higher than the management level. There's very rare internal promotion. There is no feedback loop. 

Last I checked, employees were asking for a survey to provide management with feedback. The survey was conducted. Employees asked for results. Management kept dodging the question. They know something's wrong, and they don't want to acknowledge it.

Honestly. Stay away. Stay far, far away.

I stuck it out due to pressure from family and friends who insisted that having Apple on my resume would be worth the pain. Looking back, I really can't say that it was worth the years of anxiety, depression, unhappiness, that comes from a toxic environment. It got to the point where I didn't even care anymore. I was about to snap-quit any second. And I'll be honest - I was fired. Yeah, no severance pay.

I walked off campus and I felt liberated - I had absolutely no fear from being fired, which I found incredible and surprising. I took the summer off to travel and regroup. I realized I wasn't innately a depressed or anxious individual - it had developed over time from the sheer stress and unhappiness levels from this work place environment.

I heard through friends that around 15 people left the team soon after.

Within 2 weeks of deciding I was ready to come back to work, I found a new job at an awesome company with amazing culture. I wasn't going to make the same mistake twice - I was willing to take a pay cut to ensure I spent 60 hours a week in good company. (Did I mention  overtime is the norm at Apple?)

But the best part is - that wasn't necessary. I essentially doubled my salary. Based on what Glassdoor is currently reporting, I make more money than the management that fired me.

My advice: Hold out for something better if you have the opportunity. I understand sometimes options are limited, or sometimes you just really need a paycheck. But don't come to this department to stay long unless they make some big changes.",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0

While the company shuts down for Thanksgiving, you can expect to be working in Finance. Say goodbye to family dinners, time with friends, and any semblance of a life.
- Low merit increases that don't even cover inflation and cost of living. 
- No annual bonus because management wants to keep it for themselves. No stock re-ups because you're a support function. 
- Management will take your work as their own and cut you out of meetings with leadership. You will not be recognized for any work you do so don't expect career mobility.
- Too many big egos at play. Environment hostile and full of finger pointing.  HR completely useless when issues are brought to their attention. You will meet more jerkholes here than anywhere else you may have worked in the past or future.
- Expect to work during vacations. Everyone's job is so pigeon holed in their job that there's no one to adequately back you up. Work will just keep piling up and you will be even farther behind if you do not log in.
- Management will not hesitate to contact you on your personal cell phone during all hours of the day.  They don't care what you're doing, only that they need something from you.
- Despite producing great products, the company does a pathetic job investing in systems to help employees manage the massive amount of work and pace.

-Valuable experience and development opportunities
-Managers (at my retail location) genuinely care about your personal welfare and career development (even if its outside of Apple, long term)
-Outstanding, comprehensive benefits, even available to part time employees...... if they apply to you (i.e. married parent, sick, travel a lot)
-Huge discounts on company and partner products and services
-Work life balance is taken very seriously (although salaried retail managers or corporate staff may tell a different story).
-Wholesomely aggressive commitment to company values (accessibility, environment, diversity, etc.)","-Great starting pay, but not enough for the city. Many of my single teammates who are 35-40 still need several roommates to make it by. While city market pay is higher than rural markets, it is nowhere near enough. While you do receive yearly performance based raises, they do not keep up with the high city cost of living.
-Retail and corporate are fundamentally two different companies. You don't have your ""foot in the door"". The only clear way to transition to a corporate opportunity is through highly selective ""Career Experiences"" which are literally internal temp jobs for temporary quarterly corporate needs. To just qualify, a store leader must endorse you, and you must be full time and high performing in your role. There's no internal way to really contact corporate recruiters for internships (if you're a college student) or full time opportunities. Not even your Store Leader or Market Leader knows people; you're in a walled garden.
-Human Resources is very self-congratulatory and cult-like. Executive level HR staff hold town halls to field questions every year or so (90% of which pertain to lack of comparable compensation) just to offset everyone's living concerns with ""it's a privilege to work here.""
-Bonuses come in the form of 3 year period RSUs; you have to stay with the company for three years for the RSU to vest and thus cash out. Only management and up receive comparable cash bonuses. Every year after measily raises come out, you may get a lousy $100 cash bonus to make you feel better. Some high performance quarters you may also receive a $100 bonus. Don't spend it all in one place.
-Because of this, many tenured staff leave to other high paying tech companies in Boston (FormLabs, HubSpot, Chewy, Wayfair) to continue their career because they get capped at roughly $45k without staying 5-10 more years or going into management. That looks good on paper but is the bare bone minimum in Boston.",5.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,2.0

2056,"""Apple Retail is retail 100%, set your expectations accordingly...""",I worked at Apple full-time for more than 5 years,"- Pay for a retail environment is top of the mark. Depending on your specific location, starting and entry level roles will earn between $18-$19 per hour. Each role above entry level pays you 10-20% more based on performance and tenure. If you are full-time, expect to be earning between $21-$25 an hour within just a couple of years.
- Annual pay raises (Apple calls them ""merit increases"" are typically generous, but are determined based on the stores overall performance metrics. Expect a minimum annual raise of 2-5%. 
- Restricted Stock Units (RSU's) are available and are gifted to ALL employees, part-time, full-time, entry level and beyond. These are free stock gifts that vest over a three year period. Expect somewhere around $2000 and up per year, this is an AWESOME benefit.
- Employee Stock Purchase Program (ESPP) offers you a 15% discount off of Apple stock which you use to purchase shares twice per calendar year. This is another AWESOME benefit. In my time at Apple, I saw this benefit alone make colleagues millionaires. I mean that. If you invest right and are with the company for the longterm, Apple's ESPP can make you a millionaire. 
- Overall benefits package is truly exceptional. This is the number one reason to work for Apple and/or Apple Retail. Health benefits are exceptional and affordable. Dental and vision are much the same. A ton of benefits exist for continuing your education, growing your financial portfolio, health and wellness and more. Taking full advantage of the benefits package will only help reward you further for your work done at Apple.
- Discounts on Apple products is exceptional. At least 25% off of everything (often times much more) for your personal purchases, at least 15% off of everything for friends and family. Additional ""third party"" discounts on accessory products, camera equipment, cellular service, rental car services, concierge services, auto loans, and so much more are also available. 
- 401k match is decent, up to 6% dollar for dollar once you have been with the company five years.
- Paid time off for full-time employees is decent with added ""bonus"" days added each year. Paid time off increases at the five year, ten year and fifteen year mark with the company. 
- Every employee receives sick time. Yes, part-time employees too.","- If you get hired at Apple, come in thirsty. Real thirsty. You're going to be drinking a TON of Kool-Aid. Throughout your on boarding and training experience you will be forced to drink Kool-Aid, swallow it and gulp down some more. You will be expected to sing the companies praises at every turn. This will not change, either be ready for it or you will not last.
- Management varies greatly by location, but is in general, a sad, poor excuse for a ""leader"" (they give themselves this title, it is not earned). You will, without question come across the occasional member of management of ""gets it,"" these men and women will make a profound impact on you. Sadly, they are far and few between and the rest of the junk will win out.
- Nearly everyone is hired in at the entry level roles (Specialist or Technical Specialist) and nearly everyone promotes quickly (usually once per year for the first two or three years). Once you have two or three promotions under your belt, typically just beneath the management level, your development with COMPLETELY STALL. The ""elevated"" positions (in order: Pro, Lead, Lead Genius, Manager, Senior Manager, Store ""Leader"") are limited and competition for them is stiff. If you land one of these ""elevated"" roles, get comfortable. You will be in it for a WHILE. YEARS.
- Store ""Leaders"" are NEVER in the building. Senior Managers typically run the day-to-day store operations.
- Turnover is incredibly, ridiculously, annoying high. If you get hired, please expect roughly 35-40% of your location to completely turn over per year. You will see a huge hiring increase around the fall and holiday period, hiring will stop around the New Year, people will drop like flies until the next fall, process starts over again.
- Work/life balance is a joke. Do not expect to have it. Do not expect to get any holiday's off, do not expect scheduling to do you any favors. Time off requests have to be made 4-5 weeks in advance and if you want any chance of actually getting the time approved, request it 8-10 weeks in advance. As a result of new product launches, do not even think of asking for ANY time off in September, October or November, EVER. 
- Development is a joke.
- Internal politics are EVERYTHING at Apple. You MUST ""play the game."" 
- Time and attendance policy is a JOKE. There is no penalty for being late, calling off, missing work. Other team members will take advantage of this and will leave you stranded.
- A ton of ""rules"" are in place with management that will greatly impact you. A person can only be in a role for so long (they want you to move, up and laterally, often). Expect to be in any one role for just about a year until you are pushed into something else. Please note, often times these are NOT promotions but lateral moves to ""add tools to your tool belt."" Apple's ""culture of feedback"" is a genius and evil way of ALWAYS having a justified way to pushback against your plans, development, hopes and more. EVERYTHING at Apple can be looped back to feedback, be prepared to ask management for something and for them to respond with feedback on how you need to improve first. This is a cycle, it happens over and over again.
- If you push back against the ""Apple way,"" be prepared to be forced out. ALWAYS ask for and accept feedback. Always speak highly of Apple products. Always support and get behind new services and initiatives. Always defend the customer, never your colleague. Always smile and nod. Never show frustrations, disappointment or anger. Apple wants smile robots - be one and you will go far.",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0

Every. Time. This makes you look bad as an employee because it forces you to call out just so you can get away from the work environment and give yourself a vacation you deserve. The work gets monotonous. Apple claims that they believe in giving feedback to better the work place but when you give it no behavior is ever changed. The managers aren’t terribly helpful and you are micromanaged. Apple is the first US company to make it to 1 trillion dollars and you sure don’t feel it as an employee. They don’t give you free access to Apple Music as an employee, they give you nothing but a water bottle for Christmas and make you attend meetings quarterly on Sundays which are a day of worship for many employees. The ability to move in the company is impossible and if you do want to move up in the company you have to butt kiss your managers because it’s all just a big popularity contest in terms of getting promoted to a better higher paying position.

Compensation - 2 Stars - Upper Management likes to BRAG that our compensation is lower that other tech companies because of our benefits. I’d be willing to give up student loan repayment options (I’m not eligible anyway), adoption assistance (not for me), daycare assistance (again, not for me) and RSUs if it meant I could have a paycheck on par with market rates. Raises are a maximum 5% which do not keep up with Austin’s year over year cost of living increases. The only way you will receive a raise is by a promotion.

Oh gosh, no idea where to begin. Simply put, it is career suicide. If you are offered the iOS App Reviewer position or any other position in this department, deny it &amp; look somewhere else. 

Now let’s get into the details...

The only pros are:

- Classy Apple badge
- 401K match &amp; health insurance 
- Employee discounts 

*These are the perks for now, but will likely change in the future","- Apple culture does not exist here, but instead a toxic culture does! If you are expecting to work for Apple and experience real Apple culture, this place is not for you. The sole purpose of this job is to clock in, sit at your desk for 10 hours, and be a darn robot by simply just approving/rejecting apps all day, every day. Additionally, it is a very toxic/soulless culture since there is an incredible amount of negativity created among employees due to the way management treats its employees. It is to the point where people are even scared to talk to each other during the day since management has created a culture of fear...

- Career suicide. Whether this is an early job in your career or a job taken on later in your career, it is career suicide. There are zero transferrable skills you will gain from this job. Your best bet out of this organization is to go gain new skill sets on your own. 

- Management’s idea to ensure employees are productive is to micro management them like no other. Your clock in/clock out times, breaks, computer activity, and the amount of time you spend in the bathroom are monitored down to the minute. If management feels you are in violation of any of these categories, be prepared to get talked to/monitored consistently even if you are an employee that gets work done on a daily basis. 

You as an employee must salute management at all times. Unreal. This style of management is a very childish way to manage adults and such micro management tactics breaks an organization, creates a toxic culture, &amp; makes employees rebel against each other. Due to this, you have a team where 200+ people are looking for jobs all at once, which is not something you see often...

- Lack of real managerial experience, arrogance, &amp; competence among management is a huge problem. Employees on this team have some basic ideas to solve the organization’s problems, but the lack of real management experience, arrogance, &amp; competence at a management level makes it impossible for changes to occur. If you have any ideas, they are simply not welcomed and will be shot down by management instantly. Essentially, you as an employee must accept management’s stupid ideas or go take a walk.

- Employee appreciation? Pffftt. What’s that? In this org, you are treated worse than animals. It is all about work! work! work! As mentioned earlier, you are a robot tied to your desk for 60/hours a week with zero flexibility in work hours. Also, expect to work six days a week all the time, work 12 hour days often, &amp; be *forced* to work every national US holiday. Additionally, management simply does not believe in retaining its employees, giving their employees rest, &amp; thanking employees for their hard work. Management has even taken away company events from its employees. Instead, the philosophy is to throw more work at them until they burnout &amp; quit.

- Taking a vacation &amp; falling sick in this department are considered to be a crime. If you as an individual wish to take a vacation, good luck ever getting the time approved. Everyone’s vacation time is closely monitored and it is up to the department’s discretion to decide if you are allowed to go on a vacation during the dates of your choosing. 

Also, during fall employees are told there is a strict “vacation blackout” period, which means you cannot take a vacation during September - December due to “business needs”. Such a restriction ensures employees can never enjoy a Thanksgiving or Christmas with their loved ones, which is cruel and inhumane. In addition, if you ever fall sick and can’t make it to work, expect your manager to guilt trip you for being sick the day you come back.

- Career growth? Ha, good luck. Expect zero guidance from anyone in  management on how to grow your career within the company. During your time in this department, you are expected to be an approve/reject robot &amp; nothing else. In fact, many other departments at Apple have figured out the ugly truths of App Review, which make it almost impossible to transfer internally. If you do join this department, your best bet is to look at another company for a job.

- Nepotism like no other. In this department, the ones that get elevated are the ones that simply suck up to management &amp; become close friends with them. If you are a hard worker on this team, you’ll simply be told to do more until the life is sucked out of you. Competence is not a required skill set to get elevated in this org.",1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0

This department is in shambles. The mixture of horrible management and a toxic environment that becomes worse and worse with every passing day is not sustainable. 
People reading these reviews might be confused as to why some are positive and some so negative. I will clarify that for you - look at the dates! Once upon a time working here was amazing. The previous director knew you by name and the team was very tight and close. We all worked hard but were also rewarded. More than anything there was a true sense of teamwork and community. You could rely on one another. Everyone was there to help each other no matter what their role in the department was. This is one of the most diverse departments in all of Apple and that used to be celebrated. People were happy and proud to work on that team and for each other. The older positive reviews are for the golden age of App Review. Unfortunately, those days are long long gone. 
So what happened? Management changes. And it’s been a free fall ever since. The new director put in is never there and just doesn’t care about his employees. His only concern since being put in this role has been the implementation of new tools that he created without ever having any kind of understanding or insight on how the reviewers do their jobs.
They started hiring people from AppleCare - arguably the worst department of Apple corporate. First it was the current operations manager who just has been hiring his cronies ever since. Instead of hiring from within with more than qualified candidates who also have a deep understanding and knowledge of the job function and where to improve he brings up his friends from AppleCare of his golf buddy. The managers that were with the department before have become spineless as their complaints fall on deaf ears too. Most just come in to work everyday to collect their paychecks and wait for their stocks to vest. The others have become so stressed out and take it out on reviewers by micromanaging every aspect of their time at work from what time you punch in to how long you take in the bathroom to checking your screens to see what you’re doing. Their unhappiness and helplessness trickles down to the already unhappy reviewers. 
Instead of being a united team this department is now filled with interoffice politics and drama. We no longer have fun events. we no longer have lunch provided. We work longer hours and significantly less flexible shifts. Reviewers are in fear of talking to each other and everyone is on edge. Other departments at Apple have figured this out and will not hire you from App Review. They dont want to touch us with a 10 foot pole. And so unless you decide to start sucking up with the head of operations you have no future in Apple in this department or otherwise. And trust me you do not want to be at a dead end job with this high of a work toxicity level. And if you still decide to take this job you cant say you weren’t warned.",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0

- Every once and awhile you help a customer with a heart warming story and it makes your day
- Higher than average pay for retail but at a cost (see cons)","The Dangling Carrot
- The work to pay balance isn't right. You're expected to help multiple customers at once, talk about ALL Apple Services and Store Programs with every customer, help them quicker  and quicker and constantly be in a high stress environment that makes the higher than average pay mean next to nothing when you realize you're doing the work of 2 to 3 employees
- Apple is one of the largest companies in the world and staffs it's stores like it may be going out of business any day now. Customers regularly wait 20-30+ minutes just to get the opportunity to talk to someone to buy something. This can even happen if the person knows exactly what they want, has no questions, and is ready to pay. That stress is directly put on you as leadership hides behind an iPad or in an office but tells you to work faster from afar. 
- Apple's goal is to positively impact humanity but they seem to forget their own employees are part of that humanity. Your career ambitions are ignored, favoritism is rampant, they put more and more pressure on their people while giving them less and less resources to deal with it.
- Their promotion practice is hidden and vague so that they can always make up excuses about why you aren't ready to get promoted. There are no clear metrics or avenues for job growth just management preference and their favorites are forced to the front of the queue while much more capable and deserving team members are passed over. When you're told you're not able to interview for a new position or promotion they make up reasons like ""what books are your currently reading about self development?"" or other vague open ended questions that have no right answer because whatever you say they will tell you its not good enough.
-It is a regular practice that they will handpick people for promotions, interview them, and give them the job before they even let the team know the job is available. The day the job is posted is the same day they tell the staff someone already got the position. It's ok that they choose who they think is ready for promotion but the hidden nature of the process makes it look like under the table deals and favoritism is the only way to get ahead.
- Apple has the clout to hire managers etc from outside of the company in a job role far below their last job. This means department store general managers and district managers are regularly hired as entry level managers at Apple (2 to 3 steps below their past position at their prior job). This makes an impossible void for anyone internally to get promoted to management. You're essentially shown that you need to be able to run 8-12 stores on your own before you can be moved up to be a basic manager at Apple. They give no opportunity for people to exhibit these skills internally so there will always be a very large divide between what they expect and what they allow internal candidates to show the competency for. This means that you're far more likely to move up at Apple by leaving the company, getting promoted elsewhere, and then coming back several years later to take a step down in role when you return.
- Managers do very little to support the sales floor and technicians throughout the day. They blindly stand around and wait for issues to escalate before they step in.... in the meantime they are online buying sneakers, sitting in a closed door office drinking coffee, or having meetings that have no purpose while the rest of the staff handles the pressure of the day.",1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0

No work/life balance although they say there is. 

Constant pressure if you work on the care team that you either have to multitask or finish what you are doing. 

You are very under paid compared to other tech jobs that do the exact same thing elsewhere.

2533,"""Still one of the best jobs you can have""",I have been working at Apple part-time for more than 5 years,"Working for Apple has evolved, even over the 5+ years I've been with the company. I still can't believe I get paid to talk about Apple products/services, problem solve with customers, teach them how to use their products, and engage in the evolving ecosystem. They treat us extremely well in comparison to a lot of other industries. 

When you've got the right leadership team, they know how to really step back and let you do your job. Sometimes it means a slacker will abuse it, but for the most part in a store off 200+ everyone is able to do their job and keep that customer focus. 

You can grow and achieve whatever you apply yourself towards. You're working with the best of the best and it can be tougher to grow in this company than in others, but its possible. It may mean moving stores or even going to corporate. However, if you're worth your salt and plot a path, you can go anywhere internally or leverage that to go externally to another company. 

I don't know what else to add that other reviews haven't also already mentioned. Bottom line, I'd recommend working here in a heartbeat, and even when my time working here comes to an end, it won't be because it was a bad job or company to work for.","The employee experience in the retail stores isn't what it used to be. I don't mean this in a grumpy old man, ""back in my day"" kind of reflection. It really has taken a shift towards a sales focused leadership guidance - which anyone who worked there prior to 2014 will say managers used to never mention sales numbers to the team. It was always about customer experience and the numbers from customer surveys. 

I'm not sure Angelas vision of 'town centers' is a possibility in the majority of stores. I love the idea at the flagship locations but the mall stores aren't ever going to be someones 'third place'. 

It's been a bummer watching them slow down the amount of in-store repairs. The genius' are slowly dying inside as they ship more and more things out of store for repairs. Also, they stopped sending the new genius' out for training and while it may no be necessary it was certainly a big event in many folks career here. To see Apple invest so much into you really created some loyalty and made you less likely to leave. Not so much any more.   

Yes, it's a retail environment, even though it's not a 'traditional retail' feel. So the hours can be hard on a work/life balance, but the vacation days and ability to request time off allows a certain flexibility (unless its between Black Friday and mid January and it's all hands on deck).",4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0

The results of that are

* The company is full of processes that work great for a very high average quality engineering population of 1,000 or less, but are terrible for a medium average quality engineering population of 10,000 or more. As a result management is re-inventing the terrible practices of the past, such as: 
  - Making project too big to fail rather than small enough to succeed
  - Adding people rather than competences
  - Treating everybody as interchangeable parts rather than individuals with strengths and weaknesses
  - Restraining employee mobility and growth, presumably to retain head count and talent for local reasons, which hurts the company on a grander scale

* Bad to terrible management on all levels that I encountered. Internal mobility is often curtailed and actively opposed, even though that should be one of the big benefits of working in a big company that does products on the whole stack. 

* HR is definitely not on your side. 

* Too many people seem to think that success is assured, and revert to pointless, zero-sum infighting instead of working hard to keep the products successful by delivering value and delight to the customers.

* 1,000s of uncoordinated, small geeky features added rather than 10s of simple, useful and customer-aligned features.

* Products getting long in the tooth with no new hit in sight. 

* Too many products compromized by tying them to each other without consideration for whether it benefits the customer. 

* Base pay levels below average. Bonus is too high a % of your comp.

2560,"""Takes a long long time to figure out, but once you do it's pretty great""",I have been working at Apple full-time for more than 3 years,"Apple is one-of-a-kind in a lot of ways. Its organizational structure, culture, and processes are more conservative than most of its peers. This sounds like a bad thing on its face if you're looking for the ""true Silicon Valley experience"" but I find that experience is overrated anyway.

Apple doesn't strive to make everyone friends and to foster a Google-y culture of self- expression at the office. But I find that's really nice. Don't want to have to deal with losers and idiots who you can't stand? Think if you met James Damore in person you'd want to punch him in the face (or, conversely, whatever the conservative analog is)? You will, but you probably won't know it because those people don't feel the need to express themselves personally at work. Find some people you like? Cool--you can hang out on break or after work. It's like the U Chicago of schools: some people will think it's ""where the fun goes to die""; others (like me) think it's where you go to do really valuable, interesting work and hopefully make some friends along the way.

Apple is kind of like a really really really hard video game. It takes a long long time to learn the ropes, figure out what's going on, and unlock most of the cool and interesting equipment to play with. But that makes it all the more rewarding when you do git gud and figure it out.

No one gives a hoot who you are, what your identity is, what you think should happen, etc. until you've proven yourself. It's a double-edged sword: it's a turnoff in the short term, but if you work hard and care about the product then you feel that much more empowered when you do get people to care.

Also it's a company that's in the midst of really interesting growth. If you want to have a chance to shape how products used by literally billions of people evolve, then come to Apple.

If you care about ethics and consumer privacy, Apple is also an amazing place to work: when you're on the inside you have an even greater appreciation of how hard the company works to preserve those values.","Apple's culture definitely isn't for everyone. All knowledge is silo-ed and tribal. There's no documentation. The internal tools are clunky and counter-intuitive. Sometimes the tech stack is creaky with age (though it's slowly but surely evolving).

It's not a particularly friendly or inviting place, even now after Steve's been gone for years.

Some parts of Apple are also absolutely riven with internal politics and dysfunction. This is slowly changing for the better, but for the time being I'd avoid taking positions at Ad Platforms or IS&amp;T unless you're confident it'll be a good resume boost (in case you need to bounce in a year or two, which you just might).

Apple is also a very demanding place to work for many teams. If you're working on a team that's *really* getting things done, don't be surprised if you work as hard as or harder than you've ever done in your life. That work is really valuable and rewarding, but don't come to Apple and expect as much or more leisure time as your last job unless you're coming from i-banking or something.",3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0

Great benefits, Stock options, pretty good discounts, meet some of the coolest people you'll ever meet.","ZERO. WORK/LIFE. BALANCE. ZERO underlined, and in bold. Good luck trying to ever get a shift covered in the likely event that you need to have a certain day off. Full Timers do not get to pick a designated day  off, rather, they only get a ""preferred"" day off which is never granted. 
You cannot have any weekend days off. You must have full and open availability.  Part Timers must have 4 days of full availability... which makes it impossible to be a full time student and have a job with this place. 
You will get sick A LOT. They do not use anything even close to something that sterilizes when cleaning... Oh and don't sit on those little squishy ball seats at the kids table... We call them ""pee-balls"" for a reason... 
You will be constantly micro-manged to the point it's hard to tell if they're actually harassing you. 
You will get zero training time and expected to know everything about the latest software and hardware. 
You will be constantly running around like a chicken with it's head cut off helping multiple people, answering STUPID questions that could've been simply googled from customers and coworkers. 
There is little to no opportunities for growth. Unless you become the managers little pet and bend to their every whim, then MAYBE you'll get an interview for something, but end up losing out to an external hire.
Lastly, you will not be valued there. You are just a mere cog in the big corporate machine that is Apple. They can easily replace you regardless of how much time, blood, sweat and tears you gave to that place.

 But know that there is 0 accountability for bad managers and so there are toxic teams that go undetected. HR is useless and they will have all the power if you make them insecure or if they suddenly decide they don't want to work with you.

I was part-time and I pretty much worked every single day I indicated availability for. Many full-time employees don't notice it, but for part-timers, it can be hard to balance a few different things when one weights so much more. Also, being that it is a retail store, you will also have to deal with irate/difficult customers on different occasions, especially if you break some bad news to them about their device.

2869,"""It has changed, not for the better.""",I worked at Apple full-time for more than 10 years,"Cool products, high expectations and smart coworkers.","I've worked collectively at Apple for over 14 years.  When I first started working at Apple, Inc. the group I was in was highly collaborative with many growth opportunities.  The group I was with was a complete nightmare.  These are the top issues.

1.  Severe harassment of employees that was encouraged by upper management.  Apple is not a diverse and inclusive place.  My manager, who was a female, believed that women who had children should not be allowed to work at Apple.  She complained to women in my group and to management that ""breeders"" destroyed the culture at Apple.  She told me that she will only hire young men and she has held to that promise, she hired three young men.  She said she would never hire another breeding female.  Her behavior is known by HR and management and encouraged.  When my coworker had to drive her sick kid to the doctor she was furious, she said when she was a kid she rode her bike to the doctor and she didn't understand why we had to drive our kids to the doctor.  When I was out for two days with the influenza A virus (only two days were missed) she required that I send a positive test result (which I did because I didn't realize it was illegal) to get the two days of sick time approved.  My manager also spoke out against larger size people in public spaces.  Calling people, including me fat and saying fat people are lazy and shouldn't work at Apple.   After working almost 10 consecutive weeks without a break I ended up in the ER with a heart arrhythmia.  I was told by my manager that people with my heart condition should not be allowed to work at Apple and that I should leave.  I only missed one WEEKEND of work because I was in the ER.  My manager also had a policy that if we were sick we had to publicly email everyone about our sick leave and the nature of the illness.  Talk about embarrassing.  Thankfully HR did stop her from doing this.  Also my manager and Apple in general is strongly agist.  I've been a part of interviews where hiring managers would pass by older (in 40s) candidates based solely on age.  There were also snide comments and decisions made about clothing choices (too nicely dressed) of people interviewing.  Myself and many others were repeatedly called stupid, it was humiliating.  I have 13 years of engineering with graduate degree.  If she found your work to not be of value, you were called stupid and publicly and privately humiliated.  One of my coworkers use to go to her car at lunch every day and cry.  They eventually drove her out and forced her to retire.

2.  Speaking out is strongly discouraged and if you're brave enough to speak up about the toxic culture your career at Apple will be destroyed, even if you have HR involvement.  HR promised me there would be no retribution for speaking up, they lied.   My breaking point is when my manager threatened to fire me because I wouldn't give up the name of the person who heard her talking about me and others as being fat.  After years of harassment I went to HR for help.  After an extensive HR investigation nothing was done, at least nothing I could see from my end.  Her treatment of me and my team members got worse.  Her reputation of being a lethal bully transcended our group and organization.  Her own husband admitted to my friend she would be a nightmare to work for.  The end result of the HR investigation was my career at Apple, with the help of HR, being destroyed.  Speaking up has destroyed many people within the organization.

3.  Promoting people to management position that have no idea how to manage or even interact with other humans.  Just because someone is a good engineer doesn't mean they can be a good leader. 

4.  No opportunity for growth or even transfer within in Apple.  There are some organizations, mine was like this, they took complete offense if you asked to transfer.  I wanted to learn how to automate, learn new skills and take on more responsibility.  I was told that  I was to stick to what I was doing and I would be nothing more than that.  When I first asked for support to transfer I was told I was not allowed to transfer.  When I interviewed with other groups, who were very excited to have me working with them, I was blocked by my manager.  If you want to grow or transfer, it will not happen.

5. Women are payed significantly less than the male coworker doing the same work.  For example I had almost 14 years of experience at Apple, had managed and had multiple degrees.  A male new hire who was new to this kind of engineering work (recent grad) was paid $25k more than I was making.  My other male coworkers (who had much less experience) made significantly more than I and the other women did.

6.  Apple will work you to death, literally, with no remorse.   People are fodder for the engine that makes Apple billions.  The working hours are brutal.  Families are destroyed.  Employees burn out, have breakdowns, health issues, some have even committed suicide (shot himself in the head in a meeting room).   This is true for every group I've worked at Apple.  There were many nights of sleeping under the desk, when you get a chance.  I once had 10 weeks in a row with no weekend break.  There was one week that I never got to see my kids at all.  When the weather became horrible in California I was trapped by roads that had washed out.  I was told to leave my children at home (alone) and get a hotel (which cost more per day than I made) next to work.  Because I refused to leave my kids at home for the 2 days I missed, I was called out in my review for not getting a hotel.  Can you imagine?  The stuff that happened in China and Apple was not surprising given how they treat their US employees.",1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0

The larger the store is the less it feels like a family. Employees in the genius bar are meant to focus on building a relationship with the customer but also keep the appointment sessions to about 10-15 minutes on average while also talking about: Today at Apple sessions, our business team, we are encouraged to slow down but at the same time are pushed to speed up all while trying to probe the customer so that we can figure out how to solve the issue brought in today. Managers bend to many customers who act childish and demand that they get their way but for a father who brings in their child's iPad that just won't power on anymore and they're less than a week past warranty they say, ""Well, it's out of warranty so they have to pay."" Seriously? Then that makes the employee look like the jerk because they have to relay the bad news.  Their employee rating tool is very flawed. Customers receive surveys asking how they're experience was. One rating the actual person they worked with and the other side of the survey pertains to their overall store experience outside of working with their technician. Even if they like who they worked with but didn't like the wait time or something else, then they will give a lower rating out of 5 stars and anything below 5 is a negative on the employee. Co-workers didn't go the extra mile for the customers (activations on replacement phones, making sure things transfer completely etc.) and I found myself having to clean up after their missteps. The company rolled out software that slowed down peoples phone once they're battery degraded passed a certain use and told no one, not even the employees. so for so long we would say "" oh it must be the software, let's restore your phone."" and this entire time we were giving them wrong information and we did even know it. Now there are quality programs for free or highly discounted repairs. Customers treat us like a doormat and although we were paid well; we weren't paid well enough for the things that we had to go through by being the ""face of the company.""

Working at Apple really dresses up your resume.
Expectations are very high for everyone. Consultants included.
There was a high end Latte / Espresso machine in the break area.
Private office which had no windows and was quiet.
Interesting  people to meet in the hall once and a while.
Everyone is painfully hip. The more face and body art - the more
Apple""y"" end edgy it seems to be.
People seem to watch the edgy commercials on TV and dress the part at work.

The commute bus. Huge huge perk.
Employees get a good EDD discount on new Apple products.

Working with people who code at the speed of light.

Some of the buildings and offices are private. This is a HUGE perk.

If you have a creative job at Apple and you are not keeping infrastructure running
then I think you will be very happy.

You will work with the brightest people in the world.
You may gain tattoos and face art in the process because everyone else will be wearing it.

Apple is mostly a young culture- 25 to 35 is the mean age.

My team did NOT have SCRUM. I hate SCRUM / Jira
And escaping the SCRUM disease even for 5 months was a HUGE bonus.

The Large Apple Park RING is filling up. I hear it is pretty cool in there.
But mostly Facebook style seating.
Gee, thanks Facebook (not!)","There is no life balance in some teams. 
The team I was in - everyone worked nights from home and weekends from home.
In Monday staff meeting all you listened to was what problem people solved on
their free time over the weekend.
If you want to live to work by all means.

Apple has high internal security.
Some employees are cleared with a RED badge and live behind walled areas
which other employees and consultants can't access.

You can't talk to other employees about what you are working on. Period.

You need to do exactly as you are told with no questions.

When something needs done - it needs to be executed precisely and on the day as requested. Or your job as a consultant could be in jeopardy.

Internal politics were as there is only one right way to do something and yet
your boss and his boss ""The Director"" have differing needs - can land you in
trouble as you need to decide to please one or the other.
I chose the Director. Mistake.

You will probably be required to work at home on weekends and at night.
This is not something I want to do week after week and month after month.

Know that you will be pushed to your limits and expected to assimilate any instructions instantly. 

Hint - use your iphone to take pictures (notes) of difficult instructions.

Apple is what it is.

If you are in the IT section of Apple you will have to follow orders exactly.

Being innovative. Being creative. They don't allow for any actual creativity. Something is always controlled, even if so slightly. Being a contrarian here, the kind of person that actually would challenge your peers to be better, is frowned upon. Being different isn't beloved here, being the same kind of ""different"" (actually completely the same, over and over) is.

Monthly/Bi-Monthly food can often be actually pretty disgusting. You'll find one small plate that you'll like and reccomend that same plate to everyone. Who am I to really complain about free food though, right? Except when I look at start-ups and other large companies that make Apple pale in comparison. 

Social circle supporting, as someone who has seen the good and bad side of leadership, the contrast from being in favor to not is astounding. 

Attempt at listening to employees happiness and feedback falls INcredibly short and is dependent on your being in favor. Leadership claims to have open doors, but employees have been chastized for going over their direct supervisor and upper leadership is very dismissive to anyone they do not care for. This is not open doors. This is a front. It's common word to ""pick your battles"".

Leadership openly talks trash about their direct reports to other people on the same level and below them. It is incredibly inappropriate. 

There is NO equal opportunity here, but there IS a facade that there is.  It's unreal. I'm speaking on behalf of several people who work hard who may not be a) outspoken or b) a brown noser. These few are completely passed over for the same handful of people that make friends with leadership on insincere terms.

The overall decor of Apple feels sterile and unwelcoming - and not at all creative/innovative/anything Apple is supposed to stand for!

If you are anywhere in the administrative side all I can tell you is run away! They hire very incompetent upper management who create a horrible work culture. It takes you at least 30 days to schedule an appointment  with a psychiatrist in Austin and if you ask them why it's because they are full of the Apple employees who are trying not to lose their minds! Even the doctors on campus will admit that they can't believe the amount of employees who suffer chronic stress issues because of the work culture. 

My advice is simple, if you have ambition and seek to grow in a successful career, run as far as you can from Apple. If you are a more relaxed person who only cares about getting a paycheck maybe you should consider it. 

This is the type of place that makes you regret getting a promotion. Every time you go up the latter you are exposed to more and more incompetence until you want to throw your iMac out the window! 

There is no respect for employees, no effort in providing what is needed for the job they ask you to do. Everyone is expected to deal with enormous amounts of ambiguity simply because they don't want to spend the money on clarifying anything. The internal tools are by far the worst I have had to use. Your hair will fall as the system crashes constantly and management refuses to spend the money on decent software. While I was an hourly employee we had to use a software to punch in and out except the tool would always break when you were trying to leave. It still baffles me how a company with as much money as Apple treats their employees as second class citizens compared to their customers.  

I regret spending just under 4 years of my career in this madhouse. Bragging rights are not worth it! Keep your barista job along with your sanity.

- Wait times for appointments being HOURS for same-day service and at least a week for book-from-home.

- belittling constantly
- angry customers cursing
- getting called names solely because you were the shirt and work for the company

Compensation
- They start you higher than the average retailer but for what you have to deal with and for how much the company makes daily, weekly, annually.. its actually a joke. 
- After taxes and benefits get taken out, only average $10-12 an hour. Constantly having sales and business goals to meet but no commission or incentives based on fantastic performance. Average sales were over $100,000 a month and you see absolutely nothing.

-Managers will hear you out, they do not ignore complaints, but ultimately there is little they can do. 
-Discounts on products, including a significant one you get to use every 3 years.","I am going to start with how it feels to work here. First I should say, I LIKE Apple products and own one or two. That being said, the culture at Apple feels like a professional cult. There is a definite feeling of being watched... all of the time, and then being ""corrected"" whenever you think the wrong way. 
Examples:

-Chats being monitored - any negative statements are immediately addressed by a manager you were not even talking to. (e.g. saying in a chat ""I am pissed that I am not allowed to request Christmas off"" will be followed by a manager messaging you and saying ""Let's remember to keep things positive!"")
-Your call/phone status is always on a timer.. including going ""idle"" (which is what you have to do if you need to go to the bathroom or something so you don't miss a call) and if you are idle for more than 3 minutes.. well you be contacted by the manager monitoring you that day.
-Your issued iMac is setup to allow a manager to view your screen at any time without notification to you, so you never know when they are looking at your screen. 
-Recorded calls
-Constant feeling of secrets you cannot know, like being assigned new managers every 2-3 months, or having teams broken up and re-assigned for not obvious reason. 

The list gets longer and shorter depending on who your manager is.. some are really invasive and some are really laid back. 

Some other more general cons are:
-little to no flexibility in schedule, it is basically a lottery on what schedule you get and your requests or availability have no way of being addressed. I asked about moving my schedule to accommodate a single college class and I was told there was no way to do that because they ""do not control the scheduling"".
-no break in calls for entirety of shift and no ability to walk away from your at-home desk. 
-Working holidays is required, they actually have a vacation ""blackout"" period that covers the Thanksgiving to Christmas to New Year's period where you are not even allowed to request vacation. 
-Only robotic ways of evaluating performance and being rewarded for good performance so if you are doing well, but the simplistic metric system is unable to analyze that.. then you are not doing well and no further opportunities will be presented to you. 
-Troubleshooting and resolving issues comes last in priorities, with priorities being to keep calls under 15 minutes and manipulate customers into ""feeling"" like they have been helped.. whether you actually solved a problem for them or not. 

I actually think in this position, it is somewhat of a necessary evil, because they are ensuring no time is wasted. With as many employees as they have doing this and for the pay they receive.. it is a requirement to ensure that people aren't just slacking off under no supervision in this at-home environment. However.. personally I find it the environment to feel dehumanizing and exhausting.",1.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,1.0

3275,"""A Life-changing Experience""",I worked at Apple full-time for more than 8 years,"Working at Apple retail has been a life-changing experience. The demand for excellence at Apple made every day a challenge — as well as an opportunity to grow. I was expecting the drive for excellence, but I was surprised to discover just how human and humane 'Apple DNA' is in regards to accepting mistakes and human frailties.

Apple doesn't expect any employee to be perfect, but rather they expect employees to recognize and acknowledge opportunities to improve, and to grow from those experiences. What they do expect of you as an employee is that you show up to work alert, aware, and engaged in your mission. It's definitely not a environment where you can expect to just 'phone it in' metaphorically speaking.

In my 10+ year career at various  Apple Stores I had numerous opportunities to act as a Mentor, facilitating new employee training and onboarding. I would always tell my new employees this: You won't lose your job for making mistakes — not if you apply yourself to acknowledging the opportunity it presents, and grow from it. In fact, I witnessed countless instances that make me believe that Apple values our ability to grow from our mistakes far more than they value our infallibility. I think most of those in leadership positions at Apple believe that if you never make any mistakes then you're probably not trying hard enough.

Yes, you do have to consistently be at the top of your game to have a successful career at Apple, but if you show up everyday ready to do the best work of your life, it's hard not to find yourself genuinely appreciated and rewarded through your efforts.","Working at Apple retail is an extremely high-pressure experience. The demand for service is non-stop. Apple Stores are always busy. Customers would frequently ask me, ""When aren't you this busy?"" My standard humorous response was, ""When we're closed!"" I'd say it with a wink and a smile, but it was essentially the truth!

Out of a 10+ year career at various Apple Stores, I spent about four years as a mobile-device certified technician, (a Family Room Specialist, or FRS for short). Eventually, the daily pressure of dealing with customers' issues with their Apple technology got to be too stressful for me, and I needed to take a medical leave. My store's leadership was very helpful and supportive of me throughout this period, and when I returned even allowed me to transfer to a less stressful sales position (a Specialist in Apple's terminology) without any negative consequences. I was able to speak openly with my coworkers about my anxiety attacks, and never felt unsafe doing so.",3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0

- upper management being brought in is not aligned with Apple values, taking business objectives and goals from Apple trying to implementing it internally which leads to stressed out over worker employees who either get fired or leave.
- the pay is not competitive for how much you end up working. On average a AppleCare manager works 12-14 hours daily. Yearly reviews are too harshly weighted resulting in barely 1-3% annual increases.
- advancement is tricky. If you want to move into leadership it’s not common knowledge to speak the Apple lingo and spend time frequently networking with upper management. You can spend months or years doing this before being selected for a simple rotation in the next role.

Part-time employees get some full-time employee benefits, including medical and life insurance.  There is paid time off, and paid time off for family issues such as sick kids, death in the family, etc.  These are all good things for your family, no doubt about it.

Most of the customers you’ll deal with are “normal” people who legitimately need help and will appreciate the time you spend with them resolving their issues.

The starting pay isn’t bad at all.  You can get extra hours at times.

You’ll build good experience you can put on your resume.","Remeber this if you apply for this position:  Customers will yell at you from time to time, and you have almost no recourse or backing from management if you hang up on them.  Apple’s policy toward irate customers is essentially suck it up and let them yell, which will lead to bad customer surveys for you, which will wreck your stats, which will impact your raises and your position in the quarterly shift bid process.  This policy enables the kind of person who has learned they can bully their way into anything they want and helps cause this behavior to become increasingly a societal norm.  It doesn’t take many of these types of customer calls to make you forget about all the others that went really well.

Your first two levels of management are going to be hit or miss.  You’ll love the good ones, and hope you can outlast the rest of them.  Take a wild guess at which group is the larger.

You will work 8 hours on either Saturday or Sunday.  Make sure you can deal with this and its impact on your time with your family.  You will be required to surge to full-time 2 or 3 times each year, and one of those will be for Christmas from about 2 weeks before through 2 weeks after.

-You will CONSTANTLY AND CONSISTENTLY be blamed for things that are not your fault. I have had customers blame me for misinformation which I got directly from my managers.

Rewarding experiences and lots of skills to be utilized in the real world (Apple Retail is not the real world, as much as they say it is)...Tim Cook is also trying really hard to correct the company but Retail and Corporate hate one another.","First and foremost, transparency and accountability. The hiring process is a bag of nonsense. Even internally, when you apply for a lateral transfer or a position inside your own store, the management lies to you about your chances with impunity, the Store Leader has no clout with the recruiting process yet promises upward mobility. 

There is favoritism, avarice, and a highly political nature to all hiring decisions. The customers are either incredible or absolutely horrible. This job requires the highest extreme of negotiation skills, customer service, and tolerance as people will test you beyond your limits with what they expect and require. 

Apple Retail needs to clean sweep its management tier, the majority of whom were hired from Wal-Mart, Best Buy,  Target and Pacsun...companies that share no values with Apple and love to focus on numbers. Having worked under Steve Jobs and Ron Johnson, the philosophy used to be ""work on customer experience, because the products sell themselves"" but now it is all about results even though we don't make any commission (which is insane if you do the math) and the management brags about results and company wealth while the average employee is required to know skills required for 80k tech support and IT  jobs while paying them half or less than that and asking them to perform harder on top of those unfeasible numbers.

-decent hourly pay for retail","-Weird cultish attitude among coworkers and if you don't follow the attitude of all the other Apple minions, you are really looked down on and shunned.  As an Apple employee, you must bow down and worship Apple, and if you don't, you are treated like a leper.  
-In every company meeting, training video, presentation, etc., variations of the word ""excite"" and ""innovative"" always come up.  Come on, there is more to life than Apple and some of us aren't ""excited"" at every little ""innovative"" thing Apple does (or doesn't really do).
-Coworkers seem very pretentious and fake, like ""I work for Apple.  I'm something special!  Oh, I care about you as long as I benefit from it.  If I don't benefit, I couldn't care less about you.""  There does not seem to be genuine authenticity among coworkers and lack of actual care/concern for others and backstabbing has taken place.
-Individuality is ""encouraged"", however if your individual ideas don't align with Apple's culture, you should forget voicing anything in fear of harsh criticism.
-Benefits for part-time employees aren't very good.  For a company that makes billions, the benefit package for part-time is pathetic compared to full-time.
-Training is sub-par and more ""fluff"" than actual useful training, such as ""This Apple product will change your life.  You can go to the outer reaches of space and back.  It'll blow your mind.  It's so exciting!""  Okay, how about telling me something ACTUALLY useful, such as what the device actually does, its tech specs, etc. and not silly garbage like ""It'll change my life.""  
-Sometimes, you're expected to do company training on your OWN time because you're only allotted so many working hours per week on part-time and you have no time to do the training while working in the store.  Therefore, to get training done and not go over your allotted working hours, it's expected of you to do training in your ""free"" time and not be compensated for it.
-Asking for time off is like pulling teeth, even with a supposed ""flexible schedule"".
-Even if you work only certain days of the week, company emails/texts/calls are coming in at all times/days and you MUST respond even during non-working hours.",1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0

(Explaining the title: my use of Apple Products began in the days of colorful iMacs and the Powerbook G4, during the rise of the iPod, and well prior to iPhone, iPad. At the time, there were many tremendous features, but there were certainly items that stood out as pain points. Then, month after month, year after year, the pain points were either removed or improved upon until the products were simply (far) superior to anything else I'd ever seen or used. This, in many ways echoes my experience at Apple. There were definitely aspects that were not perfect, but it was incredible to see an organization that is/was not exactly small, make surprisingly nimble strides to improve in the requisite areas.

While there, they will make you feel very welcome and included. Your ideas will be listened to, and they'll make you feel valued. Plus the benefits are some of the best in the field.","Apple is slowly and visibly gravitating from a innovative professional hardware and software company to a fashion company. Speaking from a retail perspective, many employees in the past were experienced working professionals who had deep knowledge in their respective fields be it photography, audio engineering, or filmmaking. What an employee lacked in knowledge or for upcoming software changes, Apple management and department leads made sure you were given ample development time to grow and learn. The structure then was unofficially to inspire your customers, and the sales will follow.

As time progressed, Apple leadership put more emphasis on ""people leaders"" who had poor knowledge of the product. As such, many of these new ""people leaders"" brought in from companies like Starbucks, Best Buy, Target, etc. didn't and still don’t share those same values as their passionate employees. Over time, the professionals working for the company became burned out and moved on, either by their own accord or a manager's. To fill the places of these working professionals were employees with no professional background, given little practical training on the software they were to learn resulting in having employees with poor knowledge on the product or subject if questions arose. The Apple professionals remaining in the company became complacent and/or bitter that they were being paid similar amounts as those newer employees with lesser experience, yet they were expected to assist with their deeper knowledge when a customer required it. This effect cause these professionals to exploit Apple's attendance policies resulting in less staff during a planned out day. A great example is seeing the Genius Bar become so famously behind. A lot of that is due to staff calling out for their shifts leaving their peers and lower ranking employees to pick up the pieces and learn-on-the-fly. When these problematic staff members were set to be confronted, they'd go out on leave-of-absence through stress or some sort of injury and return once the dust settles on their attendance record. This is a very deep problem Apple has yet to permanently resolve today.  

What has since become noticed and evident is how most of Apple’s newest leaders are not inspirational tech professionals. They don’t develop you to want to use the platform or software. They weren’t promoted through the ranks, but were rather hired outside the company and brought in. They’re most interested in taking you through leadership development for a few months at your same rate then throwing you back into your old responsibilities with little to show for what you’d learned. The bulk of their leaders don’t even know how to use a word processor, build a spreadsheet, or even edit a photo. They’re there to coach on sales, inspire performance, and defuse customer escalations (overriding whatever fair resolution you had positioned to your customer). It’s not the Apple environment it once was, and has slowly gravitated into a sales organization first. Sell first, then invite them back to a workshop to be inspired later.",3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0

2) Low productivity. Since the management does not know how to work smart and efficiently, they had hard time keeping up with the industry. They always sought forcing team to work in a counter-productive way, to constantly work overtime and often doubling resources for the same work (while  still had hard time making the deadline). A good engineer would find his time was mostly wasted on fixing symptoms, doing projects that were never completed or added no value.
 
3) Heavily politicized and lack of integrity. The management defended their incompetence by politicizing and siloing. They refused admitting poor results (let alone listening advices, learning or improving).  They promoted and rewarded their ""own guys"" who followed their agenda. They coerced (often made up) bad reviews on talent engineers who focused on results. A typical tactics is to make their unfavorables as scapegoats for their own failures.

There are clusters of people from other companies (ex: Microsoft) which are trying to ""put the band back together"" at Apple, and wasting time on empire building. HR is not paying attention and the ""Apple way"" is slowly getting diluted.

The secrecy makes it difficult to learn much about other internal opportunities. The generic job descriptions for internal opportunities make it hard to know if you'd like another role better, if it's worth changing roles.
Smart people, but most don't come in as experts in the job they were hired for. The interview does not reveal the nature of the work, and young talent is favored over experience.

It drags down progress to wait for the young folks earn their stripes, instead of allowing experienced folks to push ahead.

Pay is also pretty equal for people that have been in a position for years with someone that was just hired. There is no reward for sticking with the company whatsoever.
No Work/Life Balance - Operations always gets screwed over with the algorithms for shifts. People have preferences for shift times/days, give it to tenured employees first then fill with part-time as needed, as with most other companies. It doesn't make sense.
Management is inept - Some are good but others almost make it their mission to throw their direct reports under the bus because they don't know what they are doing. This would be alleviated if management was hired from within, as well as from within departments.

Also the benefits are top notch.  I work from home, so this is definitely a pro (and sometimes a con) as well.  Also if you like to buy Apple products the discounts that you get are pretty decent.","Where do I start?  'All that glitters is not gold'; 'The grass isn't always greener on the other side'.  These are a few sayings that come to mind when people say they want to work for Apple.  If you work in Applecare, you are a call center worker.  No matter how they dress it up to you.  Chat, Email or Phones.  It's a call center, so comes with it the cons of working in a call center.

Shift Scheduling - Is absolutely abysmal.  Depending on your department, you'll have to change your schedule in a little as every 3 months or 6 months. So say goodbye to any obligations you have outside of work, because when a shift is assigned to you.  It's yours, and you have to work it.  Yes, they try to sugar coat and say you can swap with someone else, but if it's already a crazy shift to begin with, nobody else is going to want it.

Work life Balance - Where? At the time of this writing you get no holidays off in Applecare (or weekends depending on your schedule).  When I first started, you did.  But now, nada.  365 days a year the queues are opened. However management (your manager) gets these days off (and weekends). How nice.

Work tools - Will never work properly.  I've never worked at a company where there was so many issues with work tools.  The kicker is you'll still need to be able to assist the customers and expected to get awesome CSATs with non-working tools.  

Micromanagement - You'll never do anything right.  If it's not one thing, it's another.  Your manager will find fault in anything that you do, it's expected.  Good calls or chats will still be nit picked and have endless ""one on ones"" on discussing how it could have been done better. They even have it written in policy on how long you are allowed to take bathroom breaks. Yep, even when you work from home.

Policy and Procedures - Can and will change without notice.You are told how to do something, you do it.  A few months later it's wrong and should never be done like that.  And when you ask why or when it was changed. No one can give you a straight answer.  They'll give you the typical 'Apple BS giving you an answer, but not really answering your question' answer (with a smile on their face).  Those that work in Applecare will know exactly what I'm referencing too.  

Final thoughts.  Management loves to ""cheerlead"" you through this muck of a work environment. They know what we have to go through isn't ideal and outright sucks, but they ignore it and speak to you like everything that is happening to you is good and we should be thankful for what Apple is doing for us. It's borderline ""cult like"". It's like serving you dog poop on a gold plate with gold utensils, and they try to convince you that it's good for you.",1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0

The training is a complete mess, they have you trained into other departments without notice and the training they provide is horrible. And the management team does nothing in regards to training to make it better for employees. The management team does some extremely shady things. Apple isn't like most normal employers who try to develop, coach and help their employees be successful. You literally are just a number. I have had several team members without any notice have been terminated and the few I've kept in contact with have said their was no prior coaching, training, or any warning. Which again also goes back to how shady and horrible the leadership team is including training. I have never worked for an employer where I felt like I didn't grow until working for Apple. Apple does nothing to develop it's employees in AppleCare, you are just phone support. They don't have development plans actively in place for their employees and truly do the bare minimum so they look good for their sketchy upper management. HR is also just as unorganized at Apple. If your needing anything done from HR it will take over a week at times, also they will say nothing but empty promises and don't really ever follow-through on what they say. I can truly say the Leadership and HR and overall AppleCare department as a whole needs a serious overhaul. I have worked several years for multiple Fortune 500 companies and from what I experienced at Apple is not what I would have expected. Also, their tools they give you to work and systems always have issues which make it at times extremely hard to do the job and the management team does nothing to help fix the issues and will sometimes try to pinpoint system issues on the team members so the managers don't get in trouble. And I would consistently ask myself does Apple even understand proper leadership skills? Management would consistently talk back about employees to the employees peers and then act normal to their faces. My manager would literally send me recorded phone calls from my peers and then try to make me trash talk with her how horrible my peers are. Also, multiple people on my team left as well as other teams including me, leaving Apple has been one of the best things I have done especially since they at the end of the day don't care and you are just a number.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

Management has favorites.
Not very supportive of employee's personal issues that may affect work, especially health or mental issues.
Overworking employees-working 6+ days in a row without a break, but due to scheduling starting on Saturday they are able to get away with scheduling employees long shifts for 6+ days at a time.
Not very flexible scheduling-they say they're flexible but then require full time employees be available 6 days out of the week and be available weekends, and part time employees have to be available on weekends and at least 4 days out of the week, (if you have plans to go out on weekends then good luck!).
NPP is supposed to be anonymous and not have retaliation but they schedule NPP chats to discuss why things were said, but it's more of a way to tell their employees that they're not getting better hourly compensation or that the work a Product Zone (formerly Red Zone) Specialist does is the same as a Technical (formerly Family Room) Specialist does. It's very demeaning and belittling to the work that Technicians and Geniuses have to do and all the training that they go through in order to even do the position, unlike sales which is much easier.
If you've been there for 2+ years they stop supporting you in what you want to do unless you really kiss up to the managers, and it has to be the right managers otherwise you're stuck.
Base salary for a new hire can be the same as someone who has been there 3+ years and they don't compensate for that and instead give the excuse that minimum wage at the time of hire affects that.

Apple retail has amazing and diverse people. If it were just up to hanging with my coworkers, doing great work and having fun I'd be running to work to be there every day. 

Apple will provide some great tools that can be used in your personal life and later professional life. If you follow how they teach it their perspectives on ""Fearless feedback and assuming positive intent"" can be incredibly useful. 

If you are young and can get in it's a great place to start, learn some skills move up a little, if you can, and then use it as a resume stuffer.","This is Apple Retail - its not really Apple. They would like you to believe that the company is one big family but the retail side is kind of a step child. The vacation structure is different as are benefits. There is NO PROFIT SHARING. and also no commission. So even if you individually do 1million in sales, you still get just your salary. 

They do not value experience or tenure. They appreciate it, like pat on the back 'great job' appreciate. But do not value it. There is no significant compensation other than additional vacation time for high levels of experience. That being the case it is good to get out sooner rather than later. They do not cultivate and give incentives for people to stay. The longer you stay, with no upward movement, the more demoralized you will get.  

Tenure and Experience and Hard work DO NOT equal promotion. Apple managers have a secret recipe on who they favor or do not. If you do not fit into a management team's vision, YOU WILL NOT PROGRESS. PERIOD. It is possible to move up and sometimes dramatically if you do fit what they want. I have seen both very worthy and very unworthy (based on their effectiveness after promotion) people promoted. 

Management is often hired from outside the company which causes a severe cultural mismatch and tremendous frustration. Potential leaders are not developed and people from outside with managers titles who might not click with Apple values are brought in on a regular basis. 

Apple essentially asks you to develop yourself. That goes for managers on down. That is an upside for people who use the Apple language and style and live it, sometimes like an automaton. However if you do not speak their development language and feed it back to them, even if you have vast leadership potential they have no way to cultivate you. I've seen people with incredible potential bypassed, grow demoralized and leave because the company cannot find ways to develop people internally, They generally overburden managers and employees so any possible time you have for development is taken away or you have to essentially not do your job and overburden others to make time to do the development things they ask. 

The company improves their systems which is helpful but essentially is only trying to make everyone (on the technical support side) take more and more people. Work in the technical support side is a thankless job often and more than it was. You are asked to help more and more people while somehow connecting personally and not making it ""transactional"". And often the customers are great but they can also be awful. Not know which you'll get EVERY 10-15 minutes!! Is emotionally draining day after day. And with managers who've never done the job they don't understand the emotional toll the job takes. 

I appreciated my time at Apple but hit a number of walls of demoralization. As did most of the amazing people around me, managers included. I managed to reinvigorate myself but with every leadership change you are essentially at square one again having to re-build your credibility. I probably should have gotten out sooner but Apple Retail also has a way of sucking you in for longer than you expect... it can get comfortable because of the amazing co-workers.",2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0

Your customers generally love seeing you.  There is a great variation of different roles in each store so it's fairly easy to find one that suits your personality.

Benefits are, by and large, better than just about any retail organization out there.  Standards are high and this tends to produce a very rewarding day to day experience for employees and customers.","There is absolutely no blueprint or roadmap for advancement.  This means you'll spend frustrating amounts of time trying to meet this quarter's ad hoc development goals only to learn that the focus has shifted in an entirely different direction next quarter.  You'll find promises are plentiful, but opportunities far, far less so.  It's not at all infrequent for people in leadership positions at other companies to be promised a fast-track into Apple Retail's leadership ranks but, too often, once you've taken the bait there isn't much you can do to move upward.

Internal promotions are exceedingly rare so don't be surprised when you find yourself working for a manager hired externally from another retailer or even a fast food restaurant.  Apple has quietly de-emphasized growth training and is now focussed on throughput at the expense of all else, including employee and customer satisfaction.  

From a products and services standpoint Apple has done very little of late to cause excitement.  If you're on the support side of things expect frequent laments from customers about the degradation of Apple's products.  Frequent recalls, abrupt cancellations of favorite services, and a general feeling that we've been here before.

-Even if you have IT certifications or lots of knowledge leadership still may not want you to use those skills outside of your main job duties because that's not ""part of your role anymore"" or ""will never be part of the role""
