Culture: Extremely collegial, very little politics and the political people get weeded out (much more so than half a dozen other Fortune 500s for whom I’ve worked)
2. International: Substantial international exposure opportunities to work with, or live in
3. Employee Development: Invest significantly in employees (e.g., Stanford program)
4. Pay: Decent salary (though not on high side in Silicon Valley, stock units should be higher Valley)
5. Career Path Opportunity Coming: Big opportunity coming to rise ranks given heavy generational weighting towards Boomers and a huge gap in Gen X’ers to manage the company when the Boomers retire (although they all seem to be hanging on longer than expected)
6. Management Team: I was almost always impressed by the calm, intelligent, non-arrogant nature of the Executives...the jerks got weeded out pretty quickly","1. Title Deflation: many people are doing the work of one level above their title given how many business units under business units there are across company 
2. Limited Career Path in Short Term (for Gen X’ers): until the top heavy Boomers really start leaving, but then there will be a huge vacuum of talent missing 
3. Mgmt. by Committee: Occasional downside of collegial culture, too many meetings to make decisions by committee
4. Late Cycle Industries/No Growth: Print is the money maker and it’s on a secular decline that 3D printing can’t make up for quick enough, and PCs can’t cover from a margin POV...it’s gonna take time to ever become a growth company again",4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0

123,"""You’ll be just another cog in the gargantuan HP machine""",I worked at HP Inc. ,"1. People. Coworkers were almost always great. 

2. Flexibility of work schedule. WFH and flexibility in working hours was great. 

3. Pay. I’ve yet to get a job that pays me even 64% if what I made at HP. 

4. Benefits Package. (PTO + insurance + retirement)

5. Company-provided equipment. (Laptops, monitors, etc) 

6. Empathy and compassion from management (depending upon your individual manager) if something tragic or traumatic happens. After the death of a parent, my boss let me take four weeks of paid bereavement leave that didn’t come out of my PTO balance.","1. The culture created by management. You’re just a cog in the gargantuan HP machine. HP cares not about your hopes and dreams or your career advancement. Even if you push hard for something like mentorship, which is something they promote, your requests will likely be ignored or pushed aside. 

2. Adherence to the bottom line creates job instability for employees. Sudden and unexpected layoff occur. I was “let go” and given fake reasons why. What it came down to was that I was laid off without HP calling it a lay-off so they didn’t have to report it, which would have been detrimental to the stock price. 

3. If you get laid off or let go, you won’t see it coming. I had a one-on-one scheduled with my manager. As we were walking to find a conference room, we chatted like it was any other day. Just chitchat. Then we walked into a conference room in a different building and he immediately hit me with the news I was being let go. When I questioned why, he gave me a made up reason related to my performance. When I challenged him and told me he was incorrect, he fumbled over his words and gave me a different reason that was equally made up. 

4. Lack of interaction with management. In the nearly five years I worked at HP, I can probably count on two hands the number of times I had real interaction (something beyond chitchat) with the two different managers for whom I worked. 

5. Also, if you accept a severance package, as I did, you will never be eligible for rehire. EVER. After working for HP for 4 years and just shy of 11 months, my severance package was a half a month’s pay, but no one ever told me I’d never be able to come back and my severance paperwork never indicated as much, either. 

6. Favoritism. This is definitely a problem. My first manager took the words of another person I worked with as the God’s honest truth when that person blamed me for a mistake she made. My manager never even asked me if I knew anything about the problem created by this other person. She just automatically assumed the problem arose because of me. I was told “you set us back weeks” after this other person mucked up some data she was analyzing for a new metric. This other person had asked me to look at the data and run a test, which I did exactly as she asked me to. I ran the test on literally 100 rows out of 100,000 rows for approximately 15 minutes and didn’t save anything. My second manager played favorites and I felt as if I had been “left behind” (for lack of a better term) while the other new hires I worked with were brought along much more quickly than I was. The other two new people on the team were given special treatment and paid special attention that I wasn’t. It helped if you were an athlete of some kind or if you liked mountain biking. That helped you “fit in” with the little clique created by my manager. Apparently I didn’t “fit in” because I didn’t join them on their mountain biking trek or their whitewater rafting trip one summer.",5.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,2.0

Based on my experiences towards the end I can't recommend anyone work for this company or support HP Inc. in any way, especially if you are differently-abled. I would not feel at all safe allowing my child to be an intern at the site I worked at and it scares me that people as young as high school age were being exposed to this environment. 

The workplace itself could be described as dingy, crowded, and cluttered which did nothing to help the generally poor environment. HP seems to have fully bought into the idea of a temporary workforce and what seemed like constant restructuring and employment thrash made this a particularly soulless place to be.

I'm sure there are some turd managers here and there, but from what I have seen they are not tolerated very long and get sorted out.

Upper management strives to provide solid financial stability to the company.","Upper management treats the workforce as interchangeable cost units that can be moved from country to country.   This means that  you can be layed off (WFR) at a moments notice regardless of how talented or how much you contribute to the company.  The depersonalization is such that people are not really called people by management they are called TCOW's(total cost of workforce -- permanent)  and RCOW's (resource cost of workforce -- contractors).

Management creates quite a bit of PR about how they value talent within HP, but the lack of training and/or apprenticeship opportunities to develop people into new or changing roles is almost non-existent.

713,"""Struggling to Regain Basic Management and Leadership Priciples Required to Suceed""",I worked at HP Inc. full-time for more than 10 years,"There are some truly great technologists working for this company that are highly competent and have high integrity.  These true leaders are technicians working on the shop floor to Fellows working to influence corporate strategy so that HP can win now and over the long term.
HP Inc has tremendous assets from the legacy handed down across many generations of outstanding contributors.  When focused on innovation and contribution, HP is truly capable of changing the world in ways no other company in the world is capable of.

There are a few managers that are high quality, skilled at their trade, and working hard to do the right thing for HP and their people.","Unfortunately, as with many companies that experienced high growth through the 1980's and 1990's they have driven the company into a protectionist position.  They are now led primarily by program management and finance principles of avoiding risk and rewarding those that avoid risk.  There is no real tolerance across many of the current HP sites for delivering true innovation and contribution to the world.  There is a lot of talk, but the actions of managers from the lowest level is completely contrary to that required to foster an environment of success.  To paraphrase a senior technologist that left the company a few years ago - ""I will be rewarded more highly if I do the wrong thing for HP"".  I hear this same concept from many of the top performing technologists - the ones that actually deliver concrete contribution.  Another senior technologist lamented the layoff of an engineer critical to the success of several projects while other engineers failing to provide any contribution other than sucking up to management are retained.

The result is that top performers are leaving - and as you can see from the financials, HP Inc. consistently fails to produce the contribution required to sustain growth.  I left HP recently because I was offered a much better opportunity and because I knew that I would be more highly rewarded at HP if I did the wrong thing for HP.  I would not do the wrong thing just to gain a personal reward.

Some Key Issues:
At many sites at least 80% of the first level, 50% of the second level, and likely 50% of the third level managers have no real experience in leadership.  They have jockeyed their way into these positions because they could not promote by any other means.  They are politicians and bureaucrats that care little for their people or for HP.  They do what they need to do, to protect and advance themselves.
Management does not know how to recognize contribution and consistently rewards low performers that suck up to management.

Very few managers know what their people do or the significance to the business.  They were not competent as engineers, technicians, ...etc - so they have no idea what competence or excellence is.

At some sites significant hiring of new college graduates is in progress.  Unfortunately, at some sites this is accomplished by laying off older competent employees to make room for the younger employees.  It is too bad to see a company that used to be the best technology company in the world to work for resort to laying people off to make room for younger people.  This is how you create a toxic work environment.  You need to win new hires by being a great company!

The toxic management climate is detrimental to work life balance.  With years of layoffs and managers protecting themselves at the expense of their people, the culture is poor in many areas.  One technologist commented to me that he was thankful for a long commute so that he could decompress from the environment before he got home to his family.  Unfortunately, many other people of integrity do not succeed in decompressing and end up taking the toxicity home with them.

The top talent leaders and innovators are leaving many sites because they see little future for HP do not feel like they can do their best work at HP.",1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0
