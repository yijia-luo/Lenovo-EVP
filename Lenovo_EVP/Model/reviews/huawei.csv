Also, there is the chance of traveling to China.","-Gave me very little information before joining and mislead me quite a bit.  Said I working with certain people but it turned out not to be true.  I met very few people before joining.

-Give me no work after joining no matter how much I ask for work.  Some people seem to have way too much work and some way too little.  Management is very passive.  For things that are critical they tell employees to get it done and they don't care at all how it gets done(i.e. they are not involved technically).  For things that are not critical they expect employees to be super active and get amazing stuff done without having to spend any of their own effort.

-Everyone is very political and nobody works together with a common goal.  Everything is centrally controlled from China and you can't see the organization chart in China, only the US.  It is very unclear what the management structure is.  Most people will have multiple managers, some in the US and some in China.

-A lot of brainwashing by the HR team during their orientation.  They play lots of videos and try to hypnotize you into thinking you are saving the world.  They make you accept a book that was published by some executives and I'm suprised they don't force you to read it out loud.

-They are paranoid about information security and have lots of restrictions which make it impossible to get anything done at work.  The management tells us to violate some of the company policies in order be able to get at least some stuff done and the IT people turn a blind eye to this.  People are constantly getting in trouble for violating some company policy.

-Almost all of the important information for doing engineering work is located in China so it's almost impossible to get anything done in the US.  All of the decision making is made there.

-There is no socializing at our company and it's very racially segregated.

-Managers are very non-technical and the skill level of most employees is low.


-During the process of setting personals goals for the year for which we will be evaluated there was no interaction with management besides extremely vague statements about what they wanted me to accomplish.  When I tried to get clarification I was blown off.

-The company strategy is to just hire very experienced senior engineers in the US with more than 15yrs experience and milk them for knowledge.  HR and management don't try to hide this at all.  They are not interested in having a permanent presence in the US and developing the younger generation here.  Huawei employs about 180,000 people.  They are constanty shifting around what people do in China so the people there are not experts at anything.

-The English skills of many of the people in the US and most people in China are very poor.  The communication style is also very indirect.  The good thing is the people in the US make a honest effort to communicate well(sometimes it's still not good enough though).  However, the bad thing is many people in China will not respond to numerous emails you send them.  There is no spirit of working towards a common goal with them.

-Nobody on my project seems to care about doing a good job.  No matter how active I tried to be to promote good ideas and directions nobody responds to you at all.  It shows the attitude of the people there.",3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0

You will travel to China and enjoy great food.","Huawei, with its military background, tends to have a culture that can encourage a battlefield-like mentality. This culture is often referred to at Huawei as “wolf culture,”  It is culture of cheating, lying, stealing Intellectual Property, stealing designs from one another. ""Kill or be killed""

High level US employees are  hired to steal US Intellectual Property. They will tell you that it is not a case during an interview.  2-3 weeks on the jobs you will be threatened with job loss if you do not provide product design of your previous employer. Once they have all they need you will be promptly terminated. People work here 1-3 years.

It is most unethical company I ever worked for. They are currently less then 900 US employees, They hire 300 a year and they currently have 250 openings. You do the math how long you will last :)

If you are not asian you will never get promoted or treated fairly.  The c-level people were all asian and wanted to run the enterprise business in america like they did in china, cutting peoples pay, cutting benefits, cutting everything.

Traveling was a joke.  Our budget for meals a day was $40 and hotels was $90 a day.  When I did travel some nights I could barely afford motel6.  This company is so cheap that they don't even offer coffee.  Only water.  They never celebrated anything.

If you were non-asian you were looked down at.  They spoke Mandarin all though out the office extremely loud and it sounded like a 3rd world country call center, and when your on the phones trying to make sales, its impossible with all the foreign language and shouting.

Don't expect anyone in HR to help you with anything or payroll, you get the run around all the time.  One month our medical got cancelled because they forgot to pay their premium so everyone lost their medical benefits and had to re-enroll.

Turn over is extremely high because they are so un-organized and treat their employess so unfairly.

2. HR is helpful","1.	DO NOT join this company in USA, especially if you are on H1B. They have a history of hiring people and firing them once the project is done. If you are on H1B, it can jeopardize your career. For GC and US Citizens, only reason you can work for this company is if they pay you well above the market compensation levels, but even then it is not worth it because of reasons stated below. Many companies are paying similar and not abusing their employees. 
2.	Poor Management. No peer technical discussion. Managers will ask you to create a project plan assuming multiple resources available. Then they will not provide the resource, and use the project plan that you created to track you back, under totally unrealistic deadlines. Managers will provide wrong directions and hold you responsible for their incorrect decision making.
3.	Lack of work ethics/decorum: Managers will pretend that they are doing you a favor by paying you more than people employed in China. They openly say in meetings that “you are paid 5x compared to Chinese employees so you should work 5x more”. No effort estimate will be done for the work. You will go to meetings and they will review the items not done and humiliate you for what is not done. Again, I have been told, “I don’t care how it will be done or how many hours is needed, it needs to be done in 2 days”. They will formally track your progress against an unrealistic schedule, probably because they would need this documentation for legal purposes when people are fired
4.	Lack of power in US: Most decisions are made in China HQ. So your manager will blame you if your group missed a bug. Everyone higher up blames people down the hierarchy to save their jobs . Your manager will expose your weakness and hide your strength, so that if some thing wrong happens, they can blame and fire you while retaining their own job. This is true whether you are a manager or an employee. 
5.	Poor infrastructure: IT infrastructure is poor. Compute resource is limited. Too much restriction in accessing documents etc causes loss in productivity. 
6.	Zero Training: Forget about training sessions. You will not learn anything because there are no training videos, poor documentation and even zero discussion. 
7.	Competition over co-operation: Managers here promote a culture of competition over co-operation. China folks don’t trust US folks and vice versa. Everyone in US wants to be manager, no one wants to work
8.	Communication problem + time zone issues: You will have to work with China folks starting from 7pm. Most of them don’t understand English properly 
9.	Lack of diversity: Practically zero female engineers and less than 10% non-chinese people
