No balance at all. Ever. And forget about any onboarding, development, tools or resources. You will be provided with nothing and expected to navigate the most outrageous hurdles at the same time. 

Additionally be prepared for toxic people in the masses. Not just one or two.... most. Including leaders and HR. Everyone had been conditioned to back stab, manipulate and tear each other down. And you can't trust HR or ER to do anything about it. There has been sexual harrasment, code of conduct violations and serious discrimination especially against women. HR knows about it and brushes it off. And In some cases they even participate in it. No urgency. No concern. No action. 

Micromanagement is constant from all levels. You will be handcuffed and expected to run around like a chicken with your head cut off on the least impactful and most meaningless work. Dont expect to enjoy any PTO either. You are always on. Unless you are a low performing dirt bag. Then you will be protected and allowed to make everyone miserable with your terrible attitude all while everyone that is decent and hardworking is expected to do your work.
