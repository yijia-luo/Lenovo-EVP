262,"""Exactly what you'd expect""",I worked at IBM full-time for more than 3 years,"The amount of people that you will meet and interact with (especially working from home) is phenomenal because there are over 400k of them around the world. If you're young enough, this can be a crash course-- almost a business degree and the inner workings of a very large company, from the terminology, the bureaucracy, and networking in general.","1) It's an old company and quite a few people are still holding out for retirement, so it’s not the “freshest” mentality. 
2) Lay-offs are extremely common, products are pushed out or sold before they're even built, and my personal biggest issue was that female managers trying too hard to be in the ""boy's club"" that is IBM. This results in a lot of unnecessary competition and jealousy between females over ridiculous stuff, but it’s really only a problem when that female is your manager. In other words, there isn't a lot of support amongst the females because there are so few and the glass ceiling seems to be on the first floor at IBM. I normally wouldn't even notice such a thing because I’m not a raging feminist, but it was cut-throat there. One or two instances, okay, maybe it's me, but it was rampant. Consequently, by the time I left, I worked for one of the best bosses I've ever had (a man) and was happy to leave on a good note. 
3) There's also a lot of nepotism because a lot of the younger people that do come to work there are almost always the offspring of someone who's worked there for most of their life. The higher up the parent, the better the gig or building address/location (NYC/Austin) for their kid. 
4) If you want to move to another position in the company, there are usually plenty, but you have to network. I held several positions in my four years there, mostly due to layoffs or complete dissolution of my department due to the whim of some organizational consultant, but I rarely landed another position from someone I hadn't networked or dealt with before. They like to do ""informational interviews"", which is just another way of finding out if they like you or not before they go through any of the enormous red-tape to do an official interview or bring you into their department. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with that, but I can imagine there are some people who aren’t really good at networking, but are phenomenal at their job, who don’t get to move up, or on, because the ONE person on the other end of the phone has written you off before you’ve even applied.
5) Used to be able to work from home, but they started changing it when I left in 2016 to making people go into unprepared and ill-equipped open-office spaces. Working from home made people more comfortable, which reflected in their work attitudes.
6) Last, but not least, were the times (too many to count) where I was instructed to work on something that was of utmost importance and urgency, only to be told hours or days later that they had completely scrapped the idea and moved on. It was hard to ever feel accomplished when what you toiled and slaved over for days was thrown out the window. I literally would stay up all night working on something my boss had told me was an emergency only to be told in the morning she’d changed her mind. Calls from Caribbean islands during a cruise were not unusual, either, as she HAD to have my password to get into a system immediately. How is that even okay?!",5.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0

Great colleagues, lots of smart people. Lots of flexibility, able to work from home.  Many opportunities to publish. I loved my work and colleagues.","Can you say red tape? Ridiculous overhead involved in the most basic of business operations. Basic operations are outsourced, and this complicates things even further. Lawyers who do not understand technology have too much freedom to restrict everything from travel to research direction, to publication, and place unreasonable restrictions on all of those things and more. Senior management isn't doing its job, and hasn't provided coherent direction. They  allowed the sales force to sell what couldn't be delivered.  How many times in my career have I seen the same mistake? Hint: it's a good idea to consult with technical staff BEFORE pursuing the sale and signing the contract. Good technical people worth their salt will tell you what the risks are and what can be done to mitigate these risks.  How do you enforce that? Easy. Sales staff should be rewarded on successful completion of contract, not just the close of the sale. That should mitigate some of the arrogance on the part of those in sales and contracts. Public business articles show many failures to deliver on contracts, contributing to poor reputation. A poor reputation contributes to fewer contracts in the future, and lower revenue.  With respect to the direction of the company, senior management is lost and scrambling. There are lots of nice speeches, with all the best buzzwords.  But sorry, the substance is not in the plan, and it's painfully clear that the senior management doesn't really know what all of those buzzwords mean, and doesn't know how to execute on them.  Redirection takes more than articulating a handful of areas of emphasis. The boat is sinking. Time to get a new C suite for this company. Finally, and most concerning, is the way that the company treats its greatest asset, its people. This company has a history of cutting an entire project, and firing everyone associated with a project, without examining the individuals they are firing. Senior management will make these decisions without consulting the line managers who know the staff.  ADVICE TO THOSE SEEKING POSTDOCS: insist upon severance pay if they terminate your contract prior to the term on your contract. Have it written into the contract before you sign. Insist on this. Make it enough to either sustain you through a search for a new job, and/or to break your lease. You will need it when IBM decides to downsize.  Why? They consider postdocs to be a way of maintaining an ""elastic workforce.""  The default contract is written so that they can show you the door with no notice (the typical 2-3 year ""duration"" in this ""contract"" is legally meaningless), and this can happen even if you are a star performer. They will cut your position before they cut a permanent staff position. You are vulnerable. Do you think it won't happen to you? It happened to me. And I was not a slacker. In 1.5 years, I was an author in 5 publications, wrote the technical content for a grant, delivered technical content for a contract, gave many public presentations, contributed to many existing projects, launched my own projects, and had external partnerships.  Senior management did not consult my manager in the decision. I had to break a lease and move, and this alone cost about $10,000, not to mention the lost income of 1 year of potential earnings, and the time between jobs. That's not chump change. Management didn't care about me, and they won't care about you, either. Someone at C-suite level issued an order to downsize my department, and that was it. Then, management tried to hide when I tried to address things with them directly. If you are a postdoc just starting out, with no financial buffer, this could put you into debt very fast. Don't sign that default contract. Negotiate it to protect yourselves, or seek employment elsewhere. Got it? Spread the word, and protect yourselves. Universities, educate your graduates, and protect them from this please.",,,,,1.0

Name recognition, lots of training materials of varying quality, large network of people who may or may not be willing to help you at all","I’ll address the most probable rebuttal first: Client Innovation Centers are not a complete representation of IBM, but any company that creates and enables a facet of their organization with this many issues should seriously reevaluate.

They do not pay enough for the work you do. This is not just a subjective claim, simple research on the job title at other companies tells you you’re getting underpaid. 

You do not get the experience/flexibility in experience they claim you get. If you stay with the company for 20 years you may be able to get the exposure you want. But the first 5 o so years, you have virtually no control over what you learn. You can be as motivated and outspoken as you want, but they will put you wherever there is a need.

Management is patronizing and disrespectful of our reasonable complaints of being underpaid and (contractually) overworked. 

The job I accepted listed 50% travel, but the CIC is at the whims of their big clients, so you will probably travel 100% (every Monday - Thursday or Friday). Somehow though, the fault comes back to you as the little pawn of an employee for not reminding everyone higher than you of your travel limits. 

During Christmas time of 2018, we were asked to forfeit our “use it or lose it” vacation time because “IBM is not doing well in Q4 because of consultant vacation time.” This is the epitome of disrespecting work life balance. Do I think the CEO would have agreed with this, had she been there? Probably not. Does that matter? No. How did a game of bureaucratic, corporate telephone result in multiple managers in multiple different meetings asking employees to not take vacation during the holidays to see their families? Horrible tone at the top.",1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0

Also, as documented in various lawsuits and industry articles, if you are over 40, there is a target in your head. You work hard, and get good reviews throughout your career, so that you reach a decent salary band. Great, right? Wrong. Because now you are too expensive for IBM to make a good profit margin, so you are a top candidate for one of the many Resource Actions. That's when there is an arbitrary order from the top for managers to cut a certain percentage of people above a certain band.

For the record, I'm still employed by IBM, and managed to survive many rounds of cuts. But I have absolutely no illusions that my job is safe.

821,"""""It's not always about the money Spider-Man""""",I have been working at IBM full-time for more than 3 years,"-Opportunity - So much opportunity to do more than just your job, passion projects, giveback to community, working with schools, internal groups, external groups.  My development job at IBM is a very small amount of the work I do, I do more for IBM outside of my lab/office just in the external giveback and working with outside organizations and groups.
-Work Life Balance - I think it's termed ""integration"" now, which i prefer, I've raised three kids here, it's never a perfect balance but that's ideal, because I get time to work when I need it but also time to drop kids off at school, go to kids sports/games, and help with homework.  I do work a lot, but it's driven by me.  There's tons of projects and things I do when the kids go to sleep or on a quiet evening because I love to do this stuff, and that's just me. 
-Community outreach- there's a huge sense of giveback at IBM.  IBM has a portal for registering volunteering and giveback and gives grants to organizations you work with.  IBM encourages and gives us a lot of autonomy on this so there's no real limit to how much you can work outside of IBM giving back to community as long as it doesn't interfere with your business commitments, and they will provide computing/tech resources/educational kits to help support it.
-Mentoring/networking-the most underated feature of IBM is mentoring, as a senior engineer  we're encouraged to be mentors to junior engineers, and while it's not required, it's extremely helpful to have a mentor, it's allowed me to navigate and plan my career progression based on their advice and experience.  Because you're in charge of your career the mentoring is the perfect amount of coaching and self-accountability that I need to stay motivated and on track in my career goals.
-People- People are awesome, I've worked with many people who work tirelessly with time they don't have to help me, or other people, to work with high school groups, to help people they don't even know within IBM who need help.  The part that makes IBM culture and values amazing is every single person you meet who is a living embodiment to them.
-Overall - The thing I love about IBM is that there's so much to do, I'm never bored, and always feel like I have an impact, but most importantly I feel like my impact is greater outside the company, and helping make the world better by being me and defining how I can give back to my community and help others. Is the pay comparable to the other big companies trying to recruit me?  No, but like Kingpin said ""It's not always about the money Spider-Man""","-Big-, IBM is B-I-G, so there's no list of steps for things like career progression, establishing internal support groups (like a gaming group for example), how to establish a community outreach event, etc. and that's mostly because no one defines what/how you do any of that, and really the way it's done is different for everyone so it's really up to you to figure out how to do all that. 
-Money - They pay well, is it great?  Not compared to the giants like Facebook, netflix, or Google, I've talked to those companies just to know what a move would look like and the money difference can be quite big if that's your motivation.
-Getting things done- I'm not sure I would do anything different for this given IBM's size, but IBM has a much more organic approach to starting things, getting things done, innovating side projects and community outreach etc, where you can start groups and projects you're passionate about, but you have to gather the support for it, you can get support and funding, but you have to originate the idea and figure out how to make it work and do the leg work for it, which is great if you're a type A personality and passionate about something.

After nine interviews I finally received an offer from a good boss and mentor.  However, after only 2 months this boss changed roles.  My new boss immediately assigned me a new sales territory.  My sales quota was $2 million annually.  After only being with IBM for 2 1/2 months, this boss called me, out of the blue, and assigned me a requirement to build a sales pipeline of $455,000 EVERY week!  This pipeline would equate to just under $24 million annually.  After our call he asked if I had any questions.  I asked two questions.  First, the weekly pipeline requirement seemed high, does anyone else who works in my role have this high of a weekly pipeline requirement?  Secondly, how can you justify a pipeline so high to a new employee?  The answers I received were the following.  To the first question the response was you are a very experienced sales person and you should be able to build the pipeline.  To the second question the response was you are responsible for achieving the pipeline and if you don't you will be let go.  As an additional comment, I sold deals after only three months on the job, but my new boss did not care of even mention the sales success that I had achieved.  At first I built the $455,000 per week pipeline.  One week was only four days, because of a holiday and I did not achieve the $455,000 pipeline goal.  My boss called me with a human resource employee, who had only recently graduated college and was new to Human Resources.  The call informed me I had three weeks left of employment and then  I would be let go.  Another side note, my bosses, second line manager had a meeting to discuss cleaning up our sales pipeline and ensuring that deals put into our CRM were true deals and realistic.  My problem was I needed to add $455,000 in pipeline every week or lose my job.  I also called my peers, in the same role and asked if they had ever heard of a pipeline requirement of $455,000 per week.  Every sales peer I spoke with stated that is an unattainable pipeline requirement. In short, I was let go for not achieving my weekly pipeline requirement.  My former boss still works for IBM.  I do not know how people like this person have a job with any responsibility.  I do not wish this person any ill will, but feel they need help.",1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0

866,"""GBS &amp; CIC: Good for recent-grads but don't stay long""",I worked at IBM full-time for more than 5 years,"If you're looking to join IBM GBS in their CIC unit, they offer a good ""party platter"" of different jobs and roles you can try out. Its is suitable for recent-grads or folks new to IT and software engineering. In this Center, you'll learn a lot of things, and you'll earn a lot of hotel/airline miles from flying every week to client sites. The CIC's clients have a range of demanding jobs. But you're never alone as you'll have the backing of a massive company behind you, ready to help. There are so many experts and SMEs within the company directory to reach out to and ask for help. This is a good place to work for people who are looking for fast paced work with changing demands, you'll end up playing all kinds of roles from dba, sysadmin, IT levels 1, 2, 3, and general programming. If you end up on a project that you dislike after a few months, you could switch to other projects if they have seats available and you get management approval. Projects are very liquid, so if you don't see something you like this week, something else might pop up next week. Your IBM assigned laptop can be Lenovo or Apple Macbook, with the Lenovos offering choice of Windows or a few Linux flavors like RHEL. But some projects require client-approved laptops that are entirely up to them. Lastly, but most importantly, you'll meet lots of smart and dedicated people. Connect with them early and keep in touch. I would only recommend people work at an IBM CIC for a year or so until they can find something else more stable or in their specific career field.","Client projects available to pick from are mostly legacy and maintenance ""keep the lights on"", and not a lot of actual programming. (Workday, SuccessFactors, RPM systems, etc.) 

The utilization reports are all that matter. You have to record your hours every week on Thursday by 4pm or managers will hunt you down, but their time-recording tool won't let you pre-set hours for the coming week. 

Your progressions are tied to how many extra hours you can bill the client, and since you're salary you won't earn OT. Progressions to the next band level are only allowed once per year. Its not merit-based. If you're ever sick and looking to take a sick-day, you'll be pushed to work-from-home instead to continue billing hours to the client.

The minimum expected billing is 44hrs/wk but it wasn't unheard of to work 70hrs/wk. Every so often, there will be a competition to see which worker can earn the most hours in a month. Some folks worked 150+% utilization during this time. The winners of these competitions would get a $25-$50 gift card. 

If you're one of the few that actually works in the Center, the office supplies are non-existent. Good luck if you need a pen, paper, whiteboard markers, or other basic supplies as they don't stock up on anything. Including coffee. And no, we weren't allowed to bring in personal coffee makers. 

Conference rooms are constantly being squatted by managers, which forces everyone to make conf calls from their cubicle in an already loud open office. You don't get an IBM-assigned mobile phone, so you'll have to share your personal phone number with managers, coworkers, and clients. 

Projects come and go on a whim. Your project can get pulled out from under you one day and the next you'll be assigned something else entirely. That next project could require travel, so starting next week you could be in New York for the next six months. 

Sometimes the bill codes for a project will stop working, so your utilization will plummet while PMs scramble to get new billing accounts in place. Which triggers your name to show up on reports other mangers see, and then they'll ask why you're not billing hours, and you'll explain the bill code doesn't work, all the while your PM is not communicating this to the upper managers in the first place. 

Even if you're not affected by RAs (mass layoffs), you'll hear about them every year. It wasn't uncommon for PMs and coworkers to disappear. It seemed a lot of seasoned workers would announce their ""retirement"", only to update their LinkedIn that they're working for another company. Again, make connections while you're here and network with these people as soon as possible. You'll never know if they'll be RA'd or retire unexpectedly.",3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0

2. A large percentage of your colleagues are incompetent. So many times, I had to chase people to do their jobs. Though, for IBM, hiring incompetent people seems like a great way to create manager jobs.
3. Upper management (at least HR) tries to 'inspire' through fear-mongering, and this trickles down to the lower levels. Employees are afraid to ask for simple, reasonable requests in fear of backlash from managers. I've also heard them directly mock their employees in front of others like a child on a playground.
- Like other service companies, IBM offers a wide variety of industries for your interest. However, management appears to 'block' most movement. Some of my colleagues were patient enough and waited 5 years for a change. Others gave up and left the company for a higher pay position in the industry they were looking for.
4. The individual target bonuses are high, but the company is leaking money, so rewards are low. On my last year, I received the highest rating possible, and received a formal IBM pdf stating my bonus was $0. What a slap in the face...
5. Disorganized - IBM has become so large that it is nearly impossible to really work 'as a team'. Like many consulting firms, IBM has resources in other countries (mainly India) due to cost. Unlike other consulting firms, the travel 'legislators' do not work well; they are not flexible. On an internal deployment, IBM travel refused to grant approval to even APPLY for a visa for my Indian colleagues because the IBM criteria of X days was not met. 
6. Too much time is spent on administrivia.

1.  Too much red tape - worse than some governments. I spend more time on internal issues (approx 60%) than client facing issues (40%). My measurement is 100% client facing. Anyone see the disconnect ? 

2. Too many people asking questions and reviewing - very few willing to do work. While it is great to get feedback and empower people - it is amazing how much time I waste listening to people who have no idea what they are saying all under the umbrella of empowerment. Results - delays and poor quality.

3. #MenToo - the company has swung too far towards promoting women. Some of my best managers have been women and my mentor is a woman. As managers, I am not sure how to deal with non-performing women as I fear the wrath of other women executives. It is becoming increasingly difficult to operate openly and be fair to all now.
IBM has become pretty much a WomenFirst company and being a woman is a clear competitive advantage now. Talent is now a distant second. Compensation, promotion, recognition - everything is looked at critically through this lens.

- You meet so many people. Met close to 200-300 in three years, definitely more than most companies.
- Lots of opportunities to travel for trainings and different events on their dime.
- Fairly flexible promotion process - if you do the work and make a good case, can get promoted in close to 6-8 months, depending on the manager and division
- Household name. It will do wonders for your future career just by having it on your resume.","- Very dependent on where you work. If you're in consulting, you could be doing anything from leading Blockchain or Watson projects to leading a project that will rarely get noticed by management.
- Some managers there have been promoted because they've been at IBM for 10-15 years and not necessarily because they're good managers. Does not bode well for turnover with younger staff.
- It's a huge company without a core product - If you ask Google, Facebook, or Amazon what they're known for, most will have a consistent answer. Very few people can properly articulate what IBM is known for. (Cloud? Technology? Services? Computers?)
- You'll do a lot of things at IBM that are not transferrable to future opportunities. Design Thinking and Agile are all done the ""IBM Way"" and they'll give you certificates and badges for completing classes on ""IBM Essentials to Blockchain"". Something that feels good in the moment but worthless when you're looking at the market.

Management's ""strategy"" can best be described as: Let's constantly implement broad, sweeping changes with little to no warning, put our employees in impossible situations, brow beat them when they fall short, then lay everyone off 3 months later. Oh, and then wonder why moral is at rock bottom. 
2. Culture... there is none. Unless you consider infighting, back stabbing, and a general ""meh"" attitude toward colleagues a culture. 
3. Get ready for an earful of dishonesty and broken promises from your managers. Managers are constantly trying to oversell employees on a job, project, move, etc. when the reality is they need someone to fill a garbage job that no one wants. Once you're in the role, they'll do nothing to help you. And every time you go to them with a problem, they'll put it back on you. Really atrocious management all around. 
4. Semi-annual changes to comp plans and quotas to put full attainment just out of reach. Did you do well last quarter? Guess what, your quota is going through the roof so save that last commission check because you won't be getting another one any time soon. Did your whole team do well last quarter? Expect the department comp plan to be adjusted... IBM is always looking for ways to pay you less while relying on the complacence of their employees to keep them around. 
5. Mediocrity, laziness and bureaucracy abound. I touched on this in #3 but it's really amazing how many people here will not lift a finger to help you, actively oppose outside-the-box thinking, and are obviously here just to collect a paycheck... if it's not in their job description, it's not their problem. At some point you'll realize that attitude begins to drain you of your motivation and work ethic, and you'll either make a choice to fight it or accept a mediocre performance from yourself. Don't expect this to be the company where you do your best work - use IBM to build your resume, put in a couple years, then move on to bigger and better things. As for jumping through hoops, get ready for a lot it; nothing gets done here quickly and without approvals, modifications, and pointless review by a dozen other managers and analysts.",4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0

1276,"""Incredible Place to Start Your Consulting Career""",I have been working at IBM full-time for more than 3 years,"When I first joined, I heard conflicting stories of love and hate for the job. Keep in mind, IBM is a massive company with over 400k employees so there will naturally be a mix of those in any big firm.  

IBM is undergoing a major transformation right now, and it is an awesome time to be an IBMer. From Watson AI to cutting edge digital transformation project partnerships with Apple, IBM is involved with a lot of cool opportunities. I joined straight from undergrad and can confidently say that I have learned immensely as a consultant and even now senior consultant. Overall, I am extremely happy with my decision to start my career as a consultant at IBM. 

- IBM = High Prestige and Brand Name... Great exposure to different industries, especially early on in your career. (been here for almost 3 years and I have worked in Pharmaceuticals, CPG, Electronics and Foods)

- Incredible support and colleagues, some really smart people work here and the educational resources/training  can be used to further your skills greatly

- As for work-life balance, it has its ups and down (way more ups for me). I've had a lot of opportunity to work remote, but also times where I'm working through the weekend on 12 hour shifts... (client dependent)

- High percentage increase in pay when promoting ( got around 38% when I went from consultant to senior)

- Flexibility in living location (anywhere as long as you have weekly access to an airport)

- Option to alt travel to another city if it is less than or equal to the cost of flying you back home (huge plus for me)

- Opportunity to earn status and free miles/points on airline/hotel chain and car rentals (I've funded numerous international trips via points I've earned from client travel-  for me huge plus)","- Make it your own culture. Sometimes you have to be a go-getter and network to get the next project. Don't expect to get handed new opportunities, other than your first year in (unless you have a proven track record). 

- Consultants here tend to get lumped into a specialized area. For example, I am in SAP and everyone in my group works in SAP. Once you are identified as a skilled and experienced user, there's a high chance of getting pigeonholed into one specific area of consulting making it hard to change down the line. 

- High travel requirements. In the client's office by Monday, home by Thursday night on normal weeks (work remote Friday). Every once in awhile expect weekend work that can be very long (although periods of remote work make up for this in my opinion)

- High utilization targets for new/newer inexperienced consultants. Being on the bench is all dependent on what you make of your first opportunities when you start. Sometimes these factors are out of your favor when you start, especially during seasons of minimal client demand. Once you gather the appropriate skills to become client facing, tons of opportunities arise and I have barely been on the bench throughout my 3 years here.

- Small raises and/or bonuses. However, big pay jump when you promote 

- Less face to face management  (I have never met my IBM manager in person)",5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0

* Free cloud account. 

As a Cloud Support Engineer (in whatever functional block/technology domain), you will have the ability to provision infrastructure and lab things out for free. This means that you will have your own lab in the cloud to experiment and learn as much as possible. This is by far the best benefit as otherwise you would be paying thousands of dollars for the opportunity.

* Direct exposure to insane amounts of enterprise technology.

If you want to become a system admin, this is the perfect place to gain the chops to do so. You will be exposed to NFS, iSCSI, virtual networking, high availability protocols, load balancers, CDNs, the full 9 yards. You can learn to be a VMware guy, a Citrix guy, a Storage guy, a Juniper/Cisco guy.. whatever you want. Exposure is accelerated based on the functional block you are placed in, which is the tech that your team will focus on.

* Free snacks and drinks in the break room.

If you love stuffing yourself with junk food and chugging Mountain Dew, you will enjoy it.","* Zero career growth. 

Your career will die here if you let it. 

IBM loves to pretend that you have a future with them. They have its managers hold these things called 'Career Conversations', and these serve as just ways to fool you into thinking that they care about your career growth when in fact this is not the case. It's just to try and inspire hope in you and try and keep you around for another year or so.

When you apply for jobs internally, you will never hear back from the managers, and the job postings will just sit there more months and months without closing. Preference for actual hires is given to external people as opposed to internal people.

* Zero useful training. 

They try and train you but it is all reading based as opposed to  experiential, and what you will end up dealing with is never what you read about. 

In this job, you are essentially being thrown out to sea. If you swim, good. 

You will -always- have to learn new things on the fly. 

* This job is essentially a call center. The 'Engineer' title you're given is just to impress customers.

This is a stressful environment and people will be calling in all the time, demanding that you treat -them- as special, and to treat all their issues as a Sev 1.
God forbid that you work in either the Network or Security functional blocks - you will always be overworked even when the other blocks have downtime, and will be dealing with WebExes day in, day out.  

* No recognition at all for your personal progress and learning efforts. 

You could become a GOD OF TECHNOLOGY still no one would blink an eye, least of all management. If you are expecting to be rewarded for going above and beyond, this is the wrong company for you.

* No raises. 

Whatever you are offered in the beginning, that's it. If you are even offered a COL adjustment, take this as a hint that your direct manager loves you and bothered to even fight for it.

* Insane amount of scope creep.

In theory, this job is supposed to be 'Support', and the customer manages their own environment. 

In practice, you are now the underpaid and overworked systems administrator of thousands of different companies, especially if you are dealing with a VIP. If that customer so much as hints at being unhappy, the technical account managers will come in and harass you until you make them happy, even if it means that what you end up doing is far out of the reach of the terms of service.

* Management does not understand your pain or what you are dealing with.

IBM is saturated with managers and middle managers who have no idea about the tech their teams deal with, and just exist to serve as an additional link in the chain. When you explain something technical to them or why something didn't work, their eyes glaze over. 

What you have to understand is the following: 

If you just want a job where you can clock in, cruise and clock out, this is the job for you. To survive in this environment, you have to be emotionally dead inside.

You can't care about anything or take anything personally, because this is the environment that management cultivates even if they refuse to recognize it. 

The customers are the priority always, even if it means that your quality of life or mental sanity takes a hit. You have to learn to tune out the angry customers, the lack of career progress and apathy by management. They do not care about how good you are. You are a meat puppet to them, make no mistakes. 

Management does not care at all about talent retention or paying you what you are worth. They will hire some college kid with no clue what SSH and DNS are to take your place.

IBM retains original IT employees for a year to two then most of them are laid off after doing knowledge transfer to overseas and regardless of seniority (from prior host company) get one month of pay severance.  The reason you are outsourced to IBM in the first place is because of cost and the reason IBM removes you from that client is also because of cost not because you are underperforming.  In order to be profitable, IBM can't be keeping and paying the same number of people right?  Because everybody at the top wants to be more  profitable and got his or her year end bonus.  You are encouraged to look for other positions within IBM, personally I haven't known anyone who successfully landed another position for any meaningful length of time, like longer than three months.  Once you are on the bench and don't have a client you are underperforming as you don't generate any income for IBM and your performance appraisal would state just that now it's kind of your fault and a very good reason to get laid off . . . .

2. The benefits are decent as well, it depends on what you’re looking for, they could be better on the health insurance side and the profit sharing bonus side.

3. Flexibility. You can move to a new team, organization, or role if you don’t feel like a fit in your current place, but find a new place that is better.

4. Most teams seem to allow for a good work/life balance (although it is variable by team, my first team was pretty bad in this regard).","1. Management is hit or miss. I have had 3 managers so far, the first one was a nice guy, but I didn’t feel like he was interested in managing (he was more technical and only met with us once per the quarter, the minimum times, sometimes even missing that deadline). The other 2 managers have been great and really seem interested in me as a person as well as an employee making me feel like I have a chance to grow in the company.

2. There aren’t many day-to-day soft benefits at our location. What I mean is there aren’t typical tech company comforts like free coffee or snacks and such. This isn’t a huge problem, but other companies in the industry do more in this space.

3. Variability in how things are run from team to team and organization to organization. If you’re not on a great team or in the wrong organization at the wrong time, that might be the reason why you have stress in your job like, bad work/life balance, bad management, constant fear of layoffs, etc.",,,,,

 I spend most of my time fielding request from users that are so frustrated they could scream. Helpdesk requests go unanswered for weeks for very basic requests. Everyone is very frustrated.

• Some employees are really old school and outdated - they make it hard to innovate and work on new ideas. They are really outdated, some can't even code and aren't technical. It's really surprising that a  senior ""technical"" worker is not technical. Stay away from employees who have been in IBM for more than 6 years. A 10 year IBM employee is a huge red flag.
• Most employees lack drive and passion. They do the minimum. (hard to innovate)
• Not enough resources to kick off awesome projects
• POLITICS (specially from people who aren't technical and are all talk)
• I often feel like we develop demos and prototypes too often to make our managers, VPs and overall upper management happy and making them feel like we are doing awesome rather than focusing on building really good products. As long as the UI is beautiful, they don't seem to care.
• Managers and senior people always play the game... it's like if they have a play book. They don't try.",4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0

2243,"""The Last Bastion of Corporate Bloat in an Agile World""",I have been working at IBM full-time for more than 3 years,"* Excellent Paid Time Off policy, particularly for employees in Essential Operations roles.

* Exposure to a very broad array of technologies and systems.

* Progressive values and strong support for equality in and out of the workplace

* Looks good on a resume","* Massive corporate bloat. The company has been around for well over 100 years, and it still runs like an old company, with numerous levels of management slowly drip-feeding decisions through a painfully dense bureaucratic process. IBM is slow to react, and when your primary competition are billion-dollar newcomers with better brand recognition, that's not a sustainable position.

* Over-reliance on archaic first-party software and systems. I get it, it looks bad if you sell your own email client but use someone else's, but maybe that's just a sign that Notes is a failed product and we should cut our losses and let Microsoft take the .01% market share we're occupying, because Outlook/Exchange is better at everything we set out to do. This applies to a number of areas of concern.

* Inadequate compensation. There's no getting around it: IBM pays below industry average in any given area, for any given skill level in any given field. Other benefits are pretty average for the industry, so the argument that they're making up for the low dollar figure in other ways doesn't hold up anymore. Career advancement within the technical side caps out really quickly, and the only way to continue your development is by going into management, which is far more stress than it's worth.

* Cultural dissonance. As IBM has made a number of acquisitions in recent years, it's failed to integrate the company cultures of those acquisitions into itself, particularly taking the good from them. Instead, it pushes a preexisting central IBM culture that isn't compatible with the way many of these smaller companies' employees are used to operating. As a result, these employees continue to see themselves as employees of other companies and not as part of IBM, and it creates an us-vs-them mentality in the organization as a whole.

* No clear plan. While we hear all the time about ""strategic imperatives"" and other buzzwords, the fact is, no plan seems to stay in place longer than a couple of quarters, and we're not gaining any ground against our ever-stronger competition. In fact, IBM is still on a negative growth trend. Everyone knows about Watson, but it's still not making us any money, so what's the plan?

* Self-congratulatory management. Various managers and executives are constantly sending out emails and lectures about how IBM is doing so great innovating in x field over y period of time, which while dubious is understandable. However, every other manager uses the opportunity to suck up to the exec in question. Call it corporate politics, but no manager is willing to tell his boss when they're wrong. It rolls downhill in a way I've never seen elsewhere.

* Ginni Rometty. I always say, anything that happens at a company can be blamed on the CEO. In IBM's case, we've had Ginni for the last 12 years, and of that time, just about half of it has been spent on a constant decline. All the while, Ginni waxes on about her strategic imperatives and how they're going to Make IBM Great Again. Prior to being the CEO, she worked in strategic outsourcing, and everyone who could tell her things she doesn't want to hear, which could help make decisions that would improve our standing, is well aware of that history.

IBM's Design program also cares deeply about company culture, and hire people that I found to be some of the best to work with in my professional career. They understand that the ability to collaborate is far more important than talent alone.

Additionally, I found extensive room to grow during my career at IBM. My boss allowed us to create our own programs, such as ""learning sessions"" to learn, for example, Github from our front end dev, and attend conferences.

- Good healthcare benefits
- Some very competent people who are fun to work with
- Early career advancement can happen fairly rapidly if you are remotely competent","- Fire drills every other day, including on weekends sometimes. Most are unnecessary and completely avoidable
- Org changes and product direction changes every 3-6months, making it impossible to deliver anything worthwhile
- Leadership micromanages to the extreme with CEO calling out product direction without any sort of due diligence. Lots of failed initiatives as a result of this.
- No clear roles and responsibilities. Result is everyone is talking and everyone thinks they are right. No one makes a final decision. I.e. ton of talking with no resulting worthwhile actions. Specifically this manifests in workshops being held every other week with 95% of them being a total waste of time, feedback falling on deaf ears, and the same organizational and product issues persisting forever.
- Vast majority of leadership is incompetent. They lack knowledge about the market, about running a modern day digital operation, and about running a financially sound business. The number of useless efforts and the resulting waste of capital is appalling.
- Turnover is massive. It is not uncommon to hear about 25-50% of teams leaving in a period of months. 
- Guidance and enablement from manager was non-existent. ""You get to go figure it out"" is not valid advice when someone has specifically reached out to you for help after trying various tactics on their own.  
- Career growth is unstructured, unfair, and not transparent. After having delivered the biggest project on the product team that had previously been to the graveyard several times before I picked it up, I saw someone who had delivered the most insignificant projects promoted to a key leadership position and then I had to convince the management of my worth over a period of 1 yr to get my promotion. After that advice on career growth included gems such as ""you need to think about how to expand your scope"". The proposals I came up with were met with suggestions of manipulating teams  or people to roll their scope into mine. It seemed after a certain level, advancement equalled duping people into giving up leadership of their scope and handing it to you.
- Manipulative, deceptive, rude culture.   
- Pay is lower compared to competitors.
- Communication and soft skills are largely lacking. Tech skills are generally there at least.

Bottom line - If getting stuff done that has an impact on the business in a civil way is important to you, this is not the right place for you.

IBM is such a huge company, and there really are so many opportunities here. I have constantly heard this phrase ""IBM is what you make of it."" While there is some truth, I do not entirely agree. Your experience at IBM really relies on luck and timing. I like to think of myself as a go-getter, ambitious and always learning new things in order to get to the next opportunity, but just being a good employee, working hard and following all the rules is no guarantee here. I have been extremely lucky in my timing in rolling off projects,  in knowing people at the right time, and have been able to take on a lot of responsibility and leadership roles. But peers who I consider good friends as well as excellent and smart coworkers have not had such luck, and it is definitely not because they didn't try hard enough. Some have even been fired after being over 100% client billable with excellent project reviews. So all I can say is - IBM does have the ability to offer you a great experience, just don't always expect it. And if you get unlucky with your IBM experience, it really isn't you, it's them. Other positives: IBM is great to have on a resume even still, exit opportunities are, for the most part, great. Only recommendation for CbDer joining, do your best to learn as many skills as possible while you're here and network as much as possible, that's what's going to get you places.","I said most above, just a few things to point out due to my personal experience:
- salary: The salary they give you is based how good your university is. This discrepancy is pretty big and doesn't make sense, the hires from the Ivy league universities are not doing any more work than hires from other colleges. It is really demoralizing.
- management: I have yet to have a single CbD manager or BPM that actually knew what they were doing or has helped me in any way. They don't receive training to manage people, especially those who do need guidance coming into their first job out of college, and the managers who are chosen do not actually want to be managers, they were forced to. IBM needs to invest in their people a lot more, get real managers, get them training, allow for these young people to be mentored and to grow. 
- quality of hires: Some of the people I have worked with here are amazing, very intelligent, and have even become close friends. The problem is that so many people here I wonder how they even passed the first screening. The quality of employee differs so greatly, and is not something I would expect from a company that is supposed to be somewhat selective. I have also seen way too many people get in because they are friends with management. I know that this happens, but at IBM this seems to be abused even more. Please hire based off of merit, not on school background or ties to current management.
- such variance in experience: Like I said, there is no one ""IBM experience."" While I do think it is good for people to have a variety of options and experiences, the variance is much too wide in terms of positive or negative experience. Don't be fooled by the common ""it is what you make of it,"" count your blessings if you have it good.",3.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0

1. IBM's policies and management are very flexible when it comes to working remotely or accommodating various life situations (sick days, doctor visits, etc.).  Management is encouraged to measure an employee by their work and impact, and not by hours spent at their office. 
2. Great colleagues!  Though unfortunately, many have been leaving due to the instability of IBM's HW development business. 
3. At least in my area, there's a high level of flexibility on which projects should I undertake based on my and my management assessment of business impact.","1. Unfortunately, IBM still uses the ""normal distribution"" rating system, where at the end of the year each employee is ranked as a top contributor (5%), above average contributor (15%), average contributor (~75%), and bottom contributor (5%).  This curve is difficult to apply in the R&D world, where you may have many members of the team working long and hard hours, and end up being ""average contributors"" at the end of the year, because there just isn't room for all to be top contributors. 

2. The above may not be so disturbing, if only IBM didn't practically cancelled all raises, performance bonuses and incentive for the non top-performers. I've had a consistent ""above average"" rating in the last 4-5 years, and my raise and performance bonus were ridiculous mere 1.5-2% of my salary.  Were I rated ""average contributor"" I would have gotten NOTHING. So you can imagine that people can go year after year without any raise to their salary.

From talking to manager friend, this is IBM's way to eliminate the non-top-performers without having to fire them, as part of its direction of reducing US manpower. 

3. Hiring freeze in many areas - again, as part of IBM's attempt to reduce its workforce across North America and Europe we see many jobs move to the India and Far East markets.  This is of course upsetting to see local teams shrink and disappear, especially when many great local IBM colleagues and experts begin to drop out. From my experience thus far working with India SW teams - they are still very far away from the standards I would have expected from US and Europe based teams.

3322,"""Application Developer Specialist""",I worked at IBM full-time for more than a year,"This review is primarily for GBS in Rocket Center, WV. If you are considering joining IBM elsewhere, just know that in this sector, and this location, things are much different than the rest of the company.

- If you either went to a smaller university or didn't do so great in school and want a big name on your resume to get you good job opportunities in the future, IBM is PERFECT for that. I'm going to get pretty heavy in the cons section, but just know that this point here was what made the experience for me so worth it!

- This location is ~2 hours away from both Washington, D.C. and Pittsburgh, and...

- If you want to travel, there are opportunities to travel. If you don't want to travel, you probably won't have to.

- Health benefits are pretty decent

- Most people get to work from home at least once per week

- There is a pretty good chance that you will get the opportunities you need to advance within the company if you want to

- If you want to become a good consultant, you will be working with a lot of good consultants.","- The location. Cumberland is a ""city"" with not much there. Most people that end up staying long term already have an invested interest in the area (nearby college, family, etc.)

- Turnover is very high. New hires come in groups, and generally if you're still around by 6 months, you are either THE last or one of the last left in your group.

- Turnover is high because when you are hired, you are put ""on the bench"". That means you have to come into work...but there is nothing to do. This time frame usually lasts between 4 weeks to over a year (it sounds nice to get paid to do nothing, but it gets old real fast).

- If you come here for experience in x type of work (development, testing, functional analyst), you're definitely rolling the dice. The ""staffing professionals"" are not technical people, they're trained to look at requirements for projects and match them to resumes. Their job is to keep you billable, not get you the experience you need in your career. There is a pretty good chance you get placed in a project doing work that you don't want to be doing (they will tell you that it is easy to switch down the road...don't take the bait).

- There is practically no technical screening (for developers). You have a technical interview and test, but you can get EVERY question wrong and still get an offer (this actually happened in my hiring group twice). So...this goes without saying...

- If you're looking to work with great developers, you're digging for needles in haystacks. You probably won't find what you're looking for. IBM has a lot of new hires that don't know what they are doing, and a lot of people with a lot of experience, but just don't make the cut.

- The pay is well below average. Not only that, but even if you are good at what you do and outperform everyone you work with, chances are a year down the road, new hires (on the bench) will be making more many than you. Management will say (this happened to me twice), ""Oh that's not right, but there's nothing I can do"". Raises happen at earliest every 9 months, and your performance generally doesn't play any significant role. Everyone gets the same raise.

- The performance review process has currently undergone a change (from what I'm told is for the better). However, managers are very inconsistent as to what the requirements are, and if you happen to be caught in a re-organization, you may quickly find out that what you are doing that was considered acceptable for your old manager is unacceptable to your new manager.

- You are told that after 2 years in this program that you can transfer out, and they will help you do so. This is true, you can, and they will...but corporate IBM will actively work against you on this. I never saw anyone get transferred out. Places like Rocket Center are where IBM actually makes their money because they can afford to pay you less for the same work that people in DC -> More winning bids on government contracts.",5.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0

The job I was put in was not what I was originally given a job offer for but I'd rather not open that can of worms.

What really upset me though was the following. I started at IBM with a below average offer that I was barely able to negotiate up to semi-decent wage. This was laughably low compared to my friends and colleagues who started around the same time I did making upwards of 20% more than I did.  and a year and a half later a new group started who were significantly less qualified than me and the lowest offer they made to them was again about 20% higher than what I was offered.

IBM boast about work-life balance and family yet the work hours in this location are expected to be no less than 50+/wk, including weekends, sometimes mandatory weekends.  Due to leaderships inability to plan properly and hire adequate amount of people to support the client, deadlines are impossible to meet.  Schedules are always tight because the leaders and project managers promise things they can’t deliver so they resort to threatening holidays and vacation time - time that doesn’t transfer over to the next year and isn’t paid out. The morale is extremely low within the department - many are afraid of losing their jobs while others are secretly demoted - simply arrive to work and find out in the most embarrassing way you've been demoted.  Employees are talked down to and yelled at while the person “in charge” sits back and do nothing.  HR is truly setup to protect IBM Truven, not the employee, and they are completely aware of the activity that goes on within the Denver office.  Only when surveys show how the employee feels about the company will they PRETEND to look into the matter, but nothing is done and change isn’t made.

There are lots of documentation, training materials, and videos that will enable you to do your job adequately.  Getting mentored is readily available, but you have to be persistent to work with the person you choose.","IBM is definitely no longer what it used to be.
1) There were layoffs constantly, so, you spent a good portion of the time worrying about if you will have a job.  Stability was not there.  The 10 years I was there, there were at least 1 ""resource action"" (as they would call layoffs) every year.  I was finally laid off in 2016.
2) PBC system, the method for rating employee performance was incredibly flawed.  Apparently, management predetermines how many 1s (best), 2s, 3s (worse), etc,  that they will give in a year.   So, that usually meant that it didn't matter how hard you worked, your score more or less was pre-determined.  Thankfully, it does appear they were getting rid of the PBC system.  The new system was implemented 2016, so I was never evaluated by that system.
3) There is NO work-life-balance.  IBM touted this as an important aspect of taking care of their employees.  Interestingly enough, they changed the term later to ""work-life-INTEGRATION"".  
4) Upper management does not seem to know what direction to take the products.  I saw products that could have been great, and could have been a dominant force in the arena they played in, be left for dead.  Notes/Domino, that messaging system could have been something great.  WebSphere/WebSphere Portal is in danger of one day not being relevant. 
 5) Constantly laying off people eventually meant that product quality would suffer, and the products did suffer!
6) There seems to be too much concern for huge customers when it came to supporting the products, but not enough attention paid to smaller companies.  You would often see a situation where fixes were only given to 1 or 2 customers.
7) The company was more reactionary than proactive.  In supporting customers, it seems like there was a habit of responding to customers that screamed the loudest.  So, that meant, customers would frequently abuse the ""critical situation"" protocols because they knew that was the only way to get attention.
8) Management is not really supportive of their employees.  You might even have a manager use an employee as a scapegoat for when something has gone wrong in a customer's environment.
9) Low morale among employees were brought about by the constant layoffs, not very competitive salaries (software engineers were routinely paid 20% below market), lack of ability to move around the company, and no bonuses.",1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0

In addition, significant investment is being made in Agile spaces (tech friendly, cutting edge work environments).  

A lot of social opportunity with extra curricular activities sponsored by IBM and managers. Mac books - an over looked perk in my opinion.  Nice to have a new machine every three years worth $2k+.  Relaxed dress code at most locations - you will see everything from full suit to star wars t shirts and flip flops (depending which department you are walk ng through).  

Healthcare is very affordable and has comprehensive options (vision, dental, etc.).

You need to plant your relationships carefully and be knowledgeable of the spider web of management and interactions.  If you are good at playing the game, you will be fine.  If you think you do not need to play the game, you are mistaken.  Tons of energy is wasted by navigating the internal politics.

Raises.  Incremental at best.  The bonus at the end of the year might get you groceries for the week.  It is embarrassing.  Promotions are not as common as they used to be with attempts to flatten the org. Just because you are a top performer, do not expect to be recognized monetarily for it.  

Senior and Middle Management is married to IBM.  Weekend emails and late working nights are common - but usually not necessary.  Boils back down to political stigma - always testing your commitment.

Death by meetings.  Despite trying to be more agile, calendars fill up with interlocks, stand ups, status calls, 1:1s, brainstorming sessions, etc.  Forcing people to get real work done outside of work hours.

Management was a joke.""",I worked at IBM full-time for more than 3 years,Absolutely nothing positive can be said about this company with any division that is related to Watson; management or otherwise.,"First to explain the background.  I worked for IBM in a different city for 2 years.  Due to my personal career goals, I wanted to work in a division that was with Watson.  At  the time, I believed all their Watson products were heavily invested in and worked well.  I was part of Watson Analytics.  I was wrong.

The product wasn't ready to send to market, and many customers were duped and mislead on what the platform could actually do.  I'm sure people are reading about how Watson-anything was overhyped.

So I relocated from this one city that had my whole life there.  Friends, family, etc...to grow my career...to another city roughly 8 hours away.

The management I had under this new team,  were the worst managers I have ever had in my entire professional career.  Pay raises that were promised to me for switching roles were unable to be placed, and when they finally were able to increase the rate...it was half of what they promised and they were only able to backpay me for 2 months when I was there for half a year.  My last manager there needs to have an HR case put against him for never showing up to work, showing up to work high, and leaving at very early times throughout the day to never return.

IBM effectively ruined my life for about a year, but  I'm bouncing back stronger than ever at a company that cares about its employees.

Difficult to keep a work-life balance as management keeps pushing for increased utilization time (Ex. for 2016, my role was assigned a  minimum 100% year-end utilization goal).

4359,"""Workday Practice - stay away! (this review is specific to IBM's Workday practice in GBS)""",I have been working at IBM full-time for more than a year,IBM brand recognition. Some great colleagues but don't expect them to still be there after November 2017 when retention bonuses are paid.,"This practice is failing. It failed in integrating the Meteorix acquisition by not providing the tools needed to succeed and then replacing the bonus with a small %'age of that amount as salary. The practice appears to be losing at least 1 experienced consultant per DAY and replaced by new consultants with 0 experience. This translates to the worker that stays there continually expected to do more while pay does not increase. 

This practice is led by SS who was the previous CEO for Meteorix. Meteorix was successful in spite of him because he had smart people around him that he was able to empower to make the practice successful. As part of IBM, he now has to stand in a boardroom and fight for his practice to get a piece of the pie against more experienced/groomed executives in other practices that are more politically savvy and he is failing miserably. His leadership team are all frustrated and handcuffed with no ability to improve the situation. It is astonishing and sad to see how quickly the great Meteorix practice has crumbled and fallen apart as a product of IBM's acquisition. 

The technology at IBM is lacking. It still uses Lotus Notes (IBM Notes) which is a great tool for administrators but lacking from an end user perspective (compared to Outlook). Other tools necessary for the job are rudimentary and may meet the needs of a large consultancy but does not work well with the Workday practice with a predominantly remote workforce. It has recently introduced Concur, Webex and Outlook but the execution is lacking (Outlook is just a front end replicating Notes) so you always feel like you're getting a knockoff version of what the real tool should do. 

The pay is not comparable to Workday eco-system standards. Base salary pay seems like it is 10 to 15% under what you would see at other Workday partner firm practices.  Also, there is no bonus for utilization (this may be a ""pro"" for some) so your ""total"" pay will be 10 to 20% less than other Workday partner firms. 

While employed, I got more spam at my work email address (from internal IBM) than I do in my gmail box. There is so much junk email coming from executives about things that you will have no interest in and you wonder why the organization is paying executive salaries to a glorified blogger. There is no ""unsubscribe"" option for these. 

The intranet has a wealth of information but is set up like a flea market. You'll have to dig thru the content that is 10 to 20 years old to find the info you need, and hope that it is current. Everything goes to a call center which seem to be in the Philippines or India. They are generally helpful for simple troubleshooting but they read from a script only so if you have anything out of the ordinary, you will spend an exorbitant amount of time trying to get something resolved. I went from spending 5 to 10% of my time on ""administrative"" tasks while at Meteorix. With IBM, this was closer to 15 to 30% of my time. This is less relevant now since utilization bonuses have been taken away but you will still find yourself working more hours because of the lack of efficiency.

4444,"""IBM is not what they advertise""",I worked at IBM full-time for less than a year,- Get to work with big name clients,"- Pay is just enough under what it should be, and they make you feel bad for getting that. I worked with my manager on a project before I was actually on his team (I was under a different manager at the time), he would constantly praise me for my work and tell me I should have a promotion and move up to band 7 (IBM's ranking system for your experience level). When I got moved to his team I reminded him of this, even sending back the emails where he specifically called this out. He dragged out the promotion for roughly 5 months, finally telling me that even though I don't deserve it they are promoting me and giving me a raise. The raise was not exactly what I had been expecting (other band 7's discussed their salary and the raise I received was roughly 20k under what theirs). A very confusing process getting told you deserve a promotion, wait you don't deserve this, here it is...you didn't earn it.
- The bonus system is designed to make you feel like you are not working hard enough. At the beginning of every year you decide how you are going to improve and discuss this with your manager. At the end of the year, even if you hit the goals and went beyond with glowing recommendations from the clients you were graded average and told to improve next year.
- The travel. I worked remote, not sure how to put that in the location...but don't get tricked by that. When I first joined IBM I was told 15% to 30% travel, for 2 years I was only home maybe 5 weeks. I may have been ok with the travel if I was busy working on something that needed to be worked on at the client's workplace, but I literally would be told to sit at a desk and do nothing for some of the clients while IBM argued with the client about the contract.
- Vacation and paternity. I was never approved to take a vacation even with over 100% utilization (which at the time was about 44 hours a week for client work). When my first child was born I was supposed to get 6 weeks paid paternity, I had to kick and scream to get 2 weeks (even though I had just finished a client's project and had nothing else lined up because I thought I would be out for 6 weeks).
- Management and general disorganization. When I first joined IBM it took 6 months before I got a manager (I joined during a reorganization of the company). It was a very confusing time since I worked remote and did not know how to do things like find a client project to work on. When I finally got my first manager he was a developer with a team of people who developed...I was a UX designer. He constantly wanted me to go back to school to learn to develop and would not help me with client projects.

Summary, not a great experience for me and I was relieved to get out. I am now healthier due to less stress and not eating like crap on the road, I see my daughter every day at 5:30pm, and I took my first vacation in roughly 3 years.

Additionally, I've been with this company for 31 years as an ""out of the closet"" bisexual woman.   Over the years IBM has been cutting edge regarding it's social and anti discrimination policies.

Recent changes now require developers to work at the office, and many talented engineers who couldn't move were let go.    Regular resource actions have seriously affected morale, and upper management's attempts at improving morale are not effective, since layoffs continue to occur.     Recent college hires are making more than higher band engineers with more experience and impact to the team's and company's success.

The company is truly a global organization, and there are opportunities for international work and assignments if that is something you want for your career - that is assuming that the hiring freeze that has been in place for most of the year is lifted...","Leadership says one thing, however they do not back up their words with actions. The company baits you in with what they call a reference salary - job seeker beware, this is not the salary you will actually get paid as (in most cases) you will be issued an incentive plan letter AFTER you start and will be told about your comp plan that be anywhere from an 8 to 18% reduction in the reference salary of what you were expecting. What this means is that in the event you ask for an 8% raise over your current salary with your current employer, and they give it to you, when you start, that 8% will actually be null and void as they take that back to incentivize you over and above your agreed upon commissions numbers - it is a bait and switch in my opinion. 

In addition to the items mentioned above, the company can't decide on a direction, and therefore the are constant reorganizations. Since joining IBM in December, I personally have been a part of three reorganizations where my role has changed. Not only does this impact the customer, but it makes is almost impossible for a sales person or sales manager to succeed as their teams are constantly changing and there is no opportunity to actually build the pipeline necessary to succeed. 

Lastly, the biggest issue of all (in my opinion) is the morale within the organization is at an all time low. This is due in large part to the items mentioned above, as well as things like IBM increasing your quota half way through the year with no justification, and making you move from a remote employee to an onsite employee, but also you couple that with the fact that IBM has experienced 22 straight quarters of revenue decline and employees wonder why we continue to try and stick this out.",1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0

If you like working in teams this is a great place for that.,"From a sellers perspective I would not recommend working at IBM. I was there over 5 years and looking back I wish I would have left earlier.  Here are the issues you will find in a sellers role at IBM.

IBM is going through a major identity crisis to make itself relevant again and it reorganizes every 6 months.  Most customers would rather not do business with IBM, their software offerings are big, clumsy, and difficult to implement. The reorgs are painful and in my case they involved new products and new customers in each reorg.  Since IBM is notoriously stingy paying commissions they will not allow any hold overs.  Bottom line if you are working a big deal and are reorged out of that account you will not receive commissions so you just wasted 6 months of your time.

On the subject of commissions be prepared for internal disputes over who gets paid on what and how the revenue is divided.  IBM only pays 80% of the deal size in commissions (they take out 20% for maintenance fees).   Thus if you received a one million dollar quota, you will have to sell 1.2 million dollars of software to make your number.

The moral is low, good people are leaving in a continuous stream and are being laid off.  Resources are scarce and in many cases located too far away to travel so your SME's are only available by phone and they are all overworked.

My advice, there are plenty of other good companies that will treat you much better and be more fair to your career.  IBM is not one of those companies.",,,,,

The company works on a wide variety of things, and it is sometimes possible to move around to different areas if you want to try something new.","Working at IBM is something like an eternal game of Russian roulette, except with layoffs instead of bullets. I survived the layoffs for almost 20 years, but eventually my luck ran out (despite never receiving a bad rating). I am still with the company as of now, but my last day will be in the next 3 months. I have seen this happen to very talented employees many times during my years at the company. The layoffs are often determined by what project you happen to be working on at the time that the layoffs are done, rather than being determined by your skills or value to the company. 

Up until recently, IBM was very good about giving employees the flexibility to work from home or even to work purely remotely from other cities. Recently it was announced that this policy had ended and all employees were expected to be on site for all working hours. For some employees, there was no local IBM office where they could work. Those employees were told they would have to relocate closer to an IBM office or they would not be able to stay with the company. This was another case where very talented employees were essentially forced out of the company.

For the past 10-15 years, it seems like the company tries to reinvent itself and entirely change directions every couple of years. But IBM never sees any of these strategies through. It tries them briefly, and if they do not pay immediate dividends, something new is attempted. On top of this, IBM has had a habit of always being late to the party. Only once cloud computing was well-established by IBM competitors did IBM start trying to get into the market, for example. It is very frustrating as a worker to feel like the company has no real direction or sense of strategy.

It also often feels like the executives making the strategy decisions are too far removed from the reality of the business. IBM has many layers of management between the regular employees and the executives that make the decisions.

Finally, and I imagine this is probably true of many large corporations, IBM treats its employees in a very schizophrenic manner. When a project is behind schedule or high priority, IBM management tells its employees that we are a family, a team, and we all should pull together, work extra hours, go the extra mile, etc, to see the project to completion. However, when IBM decides that they need to cut costs, they'll have one of their frequent layoffs (except they will only refer to them as ""resource actions"", the same way downsizing to them is ""right-sizing""). And when the layoffs happen IBM management makes it clear that this is a business and these things happen. Wait, what happened to being a team and a family?",3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,1.0

Your base pay is basically what you all get. Also, the base pay is slightly below the market average. Do not expect any perks, stocks, or cash bonuses. You won't get any. 

You will not be able to grow. Most of seniors, design leads are not capable of handling projects, mentoring juniors, proper design skills to be a lead. Managers will gossip about your colleagues during your 1 on 1.  True story.

There is no promotion and raises. This makes the morale incredibly low and encourages people to play politics and nepotism. This is place is so polluted, your skills, knowledge and capabilities will not matter. It is all about who you know. 

Most projects in IBM are very technical. Actually there is not much space for designers to play in and create a significant impact. But company is keep hiring designers to use them as a marketing tools to keep the stock price up. 

Most new grads will leave after a year. They lose so many people annually, therefore, always hiring people with a very very low bar. You should not be proud for getting an offer from this company. 

IBM Design Thinking is a joke. Nobody in the company other than IBM Design cares. You will never ever have a chance to practice what you been through from bootcamp for three months, which is totally waste of time.

Project keep gets postponed. You will never ship anything. Even if it gets shipped, developers will basically ignore your design and code whatever they want. So you won’t be able to show your work anywhere.

The designers can really push themselves on challenging domains and products.,"Every business organization is inconsistent on everything. There are many that follow IBM design thinking and others that don’t. Teams struggle to releases any product or any type of software. Which leads to a lot of designers hopping to new teams to find something better. I have seen design teams cut and the project moved to development (great way for a company being “design focus”).
 
I will only speak to what team I was on. The management is all over the place. My team went through three design leads in less than a year and a half. Our Program Director didn’t know how to deal with any of the problems in our business platform/team so they would just move people around never addressing the problem.
 
You could see how overwhelmed and inexperienced some of the design leads were. One in general couldn’t lead the team and placed most of the responsibility on other team members. If you didn’t meet demands we were blamed for failure or even an ultimatum to stay or move teams. When asked what they did they would respond with “going to meetings.” With little to no directions, you scrounged for work. If you didn’t know what you should be doing or asked what you could do you got nothing more than “You should know.”
 
There were no check-ins and the design lead assumed you were taking advantage of them. There are goals and performance system but the lead didn’t effectively use or acknowledge it until it was too late for the designer. Most of the designers left the team for new teams and some tried to stick it out in hope it would get better. Program Director should have intervened but never solved the problem but switched old designers with industry designers (A few months later everyone was moved off and development are performing design).
 
The culture at IBM design can be summed up as everyone's out for themselves and less than teams. It is my observation employees work in secret not sharing their work. If you didn’t have a loud voice or opinions, you were cut down or see as weak. How do you grow at IBM? It’s hard with a culture where you are viewed as weak.

A tenured rep was laid off for a low performing territory and IBM would give me the crap territory and 12 months to turn it around. Hard to make a lot happen in a short amount of time.

The best in the business!  IBM was my dream job a long time before I was hired FT.  Before being hired FT with a once then reputable company, I was a contractor.  The IBM Management that I reported to saw my worth and treated me and others with respect.  When I was hired, it was a dream come true.  All my hard work finally paid off.  I worked with phenominal people who were patient, and compassionate with their peers and IBM.  At that time, IBM was doing quite well.  Life was great for all until 9/11/2001 happened.   Todays IBM may be different.  It may be growing in a more positive direction.","When 9/11/2001 happened, it took a toll on IBM as well as other businesses.  The 9/11 affect was a slow trickle of poison to IBMs business.  However, I loved my job and the area I worked.  I thrived along with my peers.  Things were great until more and more resource actions were happening.  I was fortunate to be where I was until I decided to accept a job offer with no raise but a lateral move where the wind was blowing.  In the first year in this job, I worked the hardest I ever had in a job in my entire working life.  However, because I was at the bottom end of the totem pole I received an 'average' rating and NO raise.  My heartdropped and so did my morale.  I had two counterparts doing basically the same thing, and getting paid significantly more, but they were secure and up on the totem pole farther.   I knew then that I had two more years to go of being resourced.  That was the word in the hallways and it proved to be true.  Very disappointing in a company that I had dreamt of working for, for many years.   Before that, I excelled and received above average ratings and raises.  The fear of being resourced always lingered every time that dreaded news surfaced.   To me and others, this was just a way of resourcing employees.   Offer someone a new opportunity just so they can give you the shaft.  It did not matter how hard you worked.  It all depended on your placement on the totem pole.   So if you have been working in a job for a while, stay where you are at.  Do not leave.  I have applied for jobs at IBM since then, that I was very qualified for, but I am not given a fair chance.  I even had interviewed for a job before I was kicked out,  which I was positive I had, but the response I got was, 'We cannot hire you at this time'.   More disappointing news.

Career development opportunities are second to none, the internal movement of staff to new roles is a constant focus","Sometimes it can be a little bureaucratic and overly 'matrixed' - but with 400,000+ staff its difficult not to have some of that..........pay/benefits are good but not industry leading - real motivation to join comes from the career opportunity presented, the chance for personal and professional growth once in IBM and the thrill of working for an industry leading brand which is taking Watson to the world.",4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0

For now, relatively strong brand. Pretty solid employee benefits, but few perks.","IBM is an inward-looking organization, and a slow-moving one but with a few fast-moving areas. Every quarter the message from leadership is, ""We fell short overall, but our positive results in x, y, or z show that our transformation strategy is working. We all must execute better going forward."" Lay offs follow and it's up to the survivors (increasingly hardened operators) to spin even more plates, or appear to, before the axe falls again. IBM spent over a billion dollars last year buying its own stock to keep the price up, and laid off tens of thousands as part of that winning strategy. It's been doing this for many years.

In my experience, every year the volatility and toxicity of the environment grows. Top and bottom performers get smart and leave or are laid off, and what's left are the very senior IBMers and a vast middle management culture, though at this stage the wolf at the door is starting to eat them too. I guess that's the IBM version of ""Scrum"" and ""Agile"" (though teams of competing IBM experts would want to argue with me on my use of terms--may the expert with the best positioned senior director win).

- IBM no longer allows employees to work at home at all - this impacts IBM's claim to fame as promoting work/life balance and impacts working mothers. 
- IBM tends to be very clique oriented. If you are in a clique with power and financial support, then IBM can be a very good place to work. If are on the outside of the cliques with power, then you are completely out of all loops, and this lack of information impacts your ability to succeed.
- IBM grades on a curve and has quotas for performance review levels. If you are not part of a powerful clique, you can not get a high performance review. And this process discourages collaboration as employees are motivated to ""look better"" than their peers rather than support and encourage their peers. If you are in an ""inner clique"" you are only motivated to help others as long as you can take the credit for their work.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

One of my largest qualms with working at IBM was that there is no emphasis on manager relationships. You will more than likely not know and not often interact with your manager.

If you're early in your career and looking for experience without wanting to commit to a life-long employer, this is still a decent option. You'll get good exposure and rapid-fire training that will serve you well outside of this organization.","TL;DR: little opportunity for advancement, bonuses are small (<1%), raises are hard to come by (maybe every 3-5 years) and layoffs are more common, management is too top-heavy to be effective, employees shoulder the blame for poor executive decisions, salaries are non-competitive, benefits are lacking.

Brand has been so diluted over the years that at industry events and tradeshows we frequently hear ""I never knew IBM did that..."" and many still think of IBM as a computer manufacturer and few are ready to embrace whatever message IBM is pushing - are they a cloud company or focused on quantum processing? What does Watson have to do with it - isn't he a robot? The company's biggest problems, in my experience, have always come from their top-heavy structure. Too many layers of management with too few direct reports makes getting consensus extremely difficult if not impossible. As much as IBM touts their ability to be ""agile"" that really applies to the software and services they deliver to customers; internally it's a different story. Seemingly simple tasks that can be done in minutes/hours at any other company routinely take weeks or months - if they ever get the 'proper' buy-in from management, which can be rare. The company claims to ""treasure wild ducks"" but in my experience those who stick their neck out tend to get the axe. Management is very guarded in relation to their employees (seeing as how the managers easily outnumber the employees for most business units) and it makes otherwise nice people into cold managers. Managerial experience varies wildly from one person to the next - you may have someone who is sympathetic and cares about their employees or someone who could not care less about you - and there is no consistency for even small things like acknowledging birthdays or employment anniversaries. In recent years, the managers who were more people-focused have left the organization and the few who remain are outnumbered and pressured by their colleagues to be less caring. This has also created a vacuum of management who doesn't know the duties of their employees; they literally can not execute a single task that they require from their employees because they don't have any experience doing the work. This is being compounded by outside hiring of executive management who bring along some great ideas but cannot execute them because the IBM systems don't allow for it.

The new ""co-location"" strategy that IBM is employing seems a deliberate attempt to force out older workers who make more money in favor of younger, less costly employees. This maneuver comes at a time with the lowest company morale that I can remember. For the past 2  years we have all struggled with changes to systems, tools, teams, etc. while being told that we aren't doing enough (thus, no bonuses/raises while the CEO continues to get huge payouts) and we are blamed for the declining revenues of the company. For the most part, everyone dug in and rolled up their sleeves to make some headway, only to be told that now we must relocate to a pre-assigned corporate office or resign. Older/higher salary workers tend to have families and homes that can't easily be uprooted and thus are being forced to resign. For many of the long-term employees the only 'saving grace' was the ability to work from home, which saves on expenses and now that is being taken away. Although for many of us, working from home was never an option - we were assigned to a home office so that IBM could relinquish office buildings and save on rent, etc. and we are given an extremely small allowance for the costs of doing business (no compensation for internet service, electricity, furnishings, etc.).

Overall, I see the attempts to make IBM act/feel like a start-up tech company by co-locating its workers in select offices with open floor plans and ""fun"" stuff like donuts on Friday is too little too late. The company is simply too large and top heavy to function this way and unless they pare down the work staff to hundreds of people (instead of hundreds of thousands) they'll never see the results they're looking for. Which means more blaming the employees for the failures of executive orders, layoffs, and replacement of executives who will bring more new ideas that will continue to fail.

My advice to anyone looking to join IBM is to be mindful. If you're young and flexible and can survive a layoff with no warning, this still might be a good place to cut your teeth and build your resume. If you're an experienced professional looking for stability, you should probably keep looking. Everything from employee support to benefits has been slashed repeatedly and is unlikely to ever come back, so for those looking to build a career or stay long-term, you're going to be hard-pressed to build a 5, 10, 20,or 30 year tenure at IBM.",1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0

- PAY: if you went to a target school, then your pay is probably pretty good compared to your peers' starting salaries at PwC, EY, etc. (hey, that's how they trapped me here)
- TRAVEL PERKS: if you enjoy traveling, then you're in the right place to rack up miles and hotel points. You can also do alternate travel and fly somewhere else for the weekend, which is pretty nice.","Despite what the recruiters/interviewers tell you, IBM is NOT a management consulting company. Yes, we do talk to C-Suite, but only the CIO, and when we do, it's because we're either selling or implementing IBM products/solutions, not because we're trying to help you figure out why your company's profits are declining. 

Given the sales-driven and margin-driven nature of the company, here are some cons if you don't do your research thoroughly...

- MENIAL, MINDLESS WORK: as a CbDer, you're hired in to do PMO, testing, and note taking. People have this misconception that CbDers are their assistants, and will treat you as such, making you schedule meetings, book conference rooms, upload a document onto Box. There's no analytical or critical thinking required whatsoever, and definitely don't expect to be challenged. 
- LONG DURATION OF PROJECTS: IBM projects run longer than typical consulting firms, usually ranging from 6-9 months. Again, because they are mostly implementation-type work, you'll be doing the same thing (e.g. testing) the whole time. Don't expect that much exposure to different industries or types of projects. Your first project pretty much pigeon-holes you to do the same thing for the rest of your career, unless you really fight HARD to get onto something you want.
- LACK OF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT: in the CbD program, you have 3 mandatory trainings. They're a lot of fun, because you get to hang out with people in your start class. However, the stuff you learn is absolutely useless for your job. They hire a third party vendor to conduct these sessions. They teach you things like how to present better, but it's useless because you'll never be given an opportunity to present to anyone.
- CONSTANT REORG: there's been I think 3 (?) reorgs during the 2 years that I've worked here, both GBS-wide and CbD-specific. Despite IBM being an established corporation, the consulting arm is still relatively young (acquired from PwC a few years ago), so it almost feels as if we're going through the growing pains of a young company... just a general lack of clear direction and constantly shifting corporate strategy.
- LAYOFFS: during my time here, I've seen maybe 3 rounds of layoffs, which has affected people that were on my team, as well as people in my start class (yeah, THAT young). If you think you're immune from layoffs because you're a fresh college grad, think again. No one's safe here, and everyone's always on edge.
- OUTDATED INTERNAL TECHNOLOGIES: it's embarrassing how bad IBM internal technologies are being that we boast we're at the forefront of technology. Most tools employees use (expense system, travel booking system, lotus notes) SUCK. They haven't been refreshed since the 1990's and are extremely cumbersome to use.",4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0

-There's a lot of free (expensed by IBM) training/travel to cool locations like New york, Las Vegas, Dallas, and Raleigh,","-The technical sales training (for upcoming sales engineers) is virtually nonexistent, which leads to a very rough transition from the summit program to a more full time role.
-Many new hires will get stranded without a team or assignments for months on end. You will sit for weeks or months on end with maybe 10 hours of work to per week. So if you''re lazy it's  nice, but it's pretty terrible for career/skill building.

This company is best at figuring out what it can take away from the employee.  They want the employee's loyalty, but there is NO loyalty in return. Forget about raises, they are minimal (~1%) and once in a while someone may get something larger.

Read the next section.","IBM is fighting to join the 21st century with outdated thinking and tools from 20+ years ago, before collaboration became a necessity in the workplace. 
Examples: 
- AT&T conferencing: no one knows who's joined a meeting bridge and there’s no way to share your screen or files.
- Notes: The former Lotus product (desktop or cloud version, called Verse) doesn’t properly integrate with modern mobile phones (encrypted emails can’t be opened, invites aren’t properly processed, web version doesn’t have feature-parity with desktop, etc.), but that’s not a big deal since 1/3 to 1/2 of the company doesn’t access email from their phone, so they may not realize this.
- IBM just started using Microsoft Office companywide in 2016; they had been using openoffice. Think about that.
- “Charts.” Strangely, PowerPoint is called charts instead of slides. This is strange quirk that reminds you the culture is stuck in the past, presumably from when people carried binders to meetings and wrote on easels.
- The agreement you sign as you leave the company asks you to be sure to return your floppy disks. 

The culture is one of fear, intimidation, and micromanagement, and it starts from the top. When executives publicly humiliate their extended teams in front of their peers, it shuts down collaboration and ideas and kills morale. There is a constant threat made about resource actions (layoffs) which happen at random times and some people literally disappear without announcements or transitions. IBM announced they are reverting to a command and control model by centralizing on a few locations where the model will completely flip from remote teleworkers they have today to forced presence in the office. They are forcing people to relocate or resign. The offices are classic 1960s or 1980s furniture and decor depending on where you visit, though some are trying to remodel.

Made it easy to escape the soul sucking numbness that is IBM.  The 401k match used to be great until they changed it to only occur in December instead of with each paycheck.  The office is next to the Domain which has some great lunch choices, so you've got that going for you.","If you arrive via acquisition, things will be great until Transfer of Business occurs. Once you reach that milestone, anything you enjoyed about your old company will be swept away with meaningless corporate double-speak and pointless meetings.  My team was about 60 people when we were brought on board, and after three years only 5 remain.

The entire point of US based IBM is to fire all senior people, outsource all work overseas, and hire recent graduates for minimal salaries.  The entire time I was at IBM, there was zero positive feedback from upper level management, which is ironic since IBM acquired my company because we were beating them left and right in the market.  The acquisitions only occur to remove competition.  Other teams will absorb your product and fight for the scraps.  Once Transfer of Business and Bluewashing are complete, you are expendable.

Everything IBM does is to encourage US based employees to quit.  Changing the 401k match to only occur once a year was another example of this mentality. Stack ranking employees and firing a set percentage every quarter has occurred at IBM every year for the past decade.  Zero perks like coffee or even water, obsolete technology, terrible internal tools like Lotus Notes, complete lack of concern for the team.  The only thing that matters is the stock price and delivering dividends to the stockholders.  Respect for employees is not even on the list.

The benefits are minimal.  IBM health insurance charges you per child, up to six kids.  If you have a larger family you will be paying massively for poor coverage. 401k match is insulting, the only free perk is water in the water fountains.  Even the benefit of working from home is being removed, which makes sense since IBM frowns on any type of 'perk' or 'benefit' for the rank-and-file employees.

My advice, don't even consider working here.  You will not be appreciated in any way.  If you are acquired, leave once your stock vests and don't bother contributing while there.  Anything you used to love about your company is meaningless once you were acquired by this place.",2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0

(Unfortunately they just announced only upline managers will have an assigned HR contact.  That doesn't have a big impact on me, but will be difficult for new managers or new IBMers).

- I've been able to find good talent for my teams internally in IBM.  I'd say that about 1/3 to 1/2 of the employees on each team I've been in have been extremely dedicated to their work and their customers. 

- The sales org seems to be addressing some of the complacency in their ranks, and I've had very positive experiences with most of the newer sellers they have hired.  It seems there is more pressure now for sellers to take ownership of their accounts *after* (and not just until) their commission comes in.

- It's pretty easy to move internally if you have a good reputation or good performance ratings.  You may encounter resistance from your management, but they're not allowed to block your movement indefinitely.","- No work life balance.  I work at least 10 hours most days plus reply to email all weekend (as is expected by management).  Similarly, you are expected to check/reply to email and take meetings when you take a vacation day. The vacation time expires every year, so it's not like you can even bank the time when you have to work all day on vacation.   I have taken a lunch break less than 30 times total in the past 10 years.  I hear you have to actually book a meeting on your calendar in order to have time to step away to eat, instead of muting yourself on the phone meeting you've taken.

- Benefits have eroded over the years.  Our health insurance options are still decent but have gotten much more expensive, with higher deductibles and lesser coverage every single year.  This is particularly true for family coverage.  Many of us use our spouse's insurance if they work elsewhere.  Our 401k matching used to be great.  They have cut the matching in half and now only match at the end of the year. This means if they lay you off on Dec 30, you get nothing. (Yes, they did lay people off in December).  Quite a few people who are doing ""good"" but not stellar work have not seen a raise in 5+ years. 

- Constant layoffs. Of course it doesn't hit every business unit or every group every time, but we are always doing ""Resource Actions.""  As a manager, I have to constantly be prepared to submit names for upcoming RA's.  The RA's are NOT limited to low performers or areas where there has been a work reduction.  I'm supposedly in a growing part of the business, but the job growth is not in the US.  Despite what our CEO tells Trump or the media.

- I like the new performance review system in theory, but in practice assessments were handled poorly in 2016. We were strong armed into decreasing employee's ratings without any explanation of why or what the expectations were for average or above average ratings.  There is a disconnect as my team is viewed as high performing, but I'm not permitted to give them high performing ratings.  

- We are just wrapping up our bonus planning, which occurs once a year.  I was able to give 0.5%-1% bonuses to employees who were high performing.  It was the worst ""bucket"" I've ever seen, but not by much.  It's rare to get a bonus of more than a few thousand, no matter how good your results were.  Obviously, it's different for middle & upper management and for sales. 

- The scope of our jobs keeps changing and growing, because they lay off people and add those responsibilities to existing staff.  Currently, I'm doing the work that was spread across three people last year. (I was already pretty busy before this change). My story isn't unique.  There is little or no training when you are forced to assume responsibility for tasks that were previously not part of your job. 

- Lots of favoritism. I say this as someone who is seen as a top performer and a favorite! I've worked in four business units at IBM, and in each, upline management has a very obvious bias towards some employees and against others, which does not align with recent performance.   I also can't believe how much gossiping and in-fighting there is.  I get enough childishness from my children!  Who needs that at work?

- The ""back to the office"" movement is in full swing, as well as forced relocation.  Yes, getting to work from home at all was a perk, not a right, but it was very transparent, especially in management calls, that this was done to encourage attrition.  Not enough people quit because of this policy, they are now doing layoffs. 

- Constant ""transformation"" churn. Every year, our execs decide they are going to reinvent the wheel when it comes to internal processes.  Every year we waste tens of thousands of man hours pursuing these ""transformation"" projects that never actually result in any significant changes.  I'd welcome transformation if our executives were genuinely interested in it instead of just holding many, many meetings to talk about needing to transform.  

- ""IBM - I've Been Meeting"" - in management, you will spend the vast majority of time in meetings that could have been replaced with a quick email; meetings to discuss what to do in the other meeting about the same topic that day; etc.  We're terrible at collaborating.  Interestingly, despite so many meetings, most people I know at IBM have difficulty understanding and communicating what their organization's objectives and priorities are, as the information that trickles down from upper management is pretty limited.

- Mentoring is talked about constantly, and yet maybe 5% of the people I know at IBM have a mentor.   To be fair, most people don't have the time.  Similarly, we used to have a robust talent program where the top 5-10% of employees were groomed for more senior roles.  This was dismantled and the replacement feels very much like ""you're on your own.""",1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0

In the end, this is a poor reflection on the value the executive team places on their employees. Anyone is expendable and the people who work here know it and live it every day.

Ask yourself if this is really the climate you want to work in. Because even if you are younger and they make you feel wanted/welcome right now, you will eventually reach a point where you are expendable at their whim.
2. Management highly political and is an ""old boys"" network with no shame and lots of favoritism.
3. The company executive team makes very poor product investment and marketing decisions. They are almost always behind the market with investments and acquisitions, and then they ""blame"" the product development and sales teams for the poor results by firing and laying them off when the executive team is responsible themselves.

5. Atmosphere of constant layoffs and firings. Not once every few years as a result of a necessary reorg or restructuring, but at least once per year if not more often.

IBM senior management views employees as depreciating assets, not as human beings. The LAST concern in the company is how moves and strategies will affect employees financially and morale-wise. 

The only area where senior management shows real innovation is in coming up with ways save money by taking things away from employees.  Recent Examples: replacement of lump sum pensions with 'enhanced' 401k contributions, 401k match moved to end-of-year, reduction of severance from a max of 6 months to only 1 month, the essential elimination of raises, elimination of the Thanks program.

Mass firings (Resource Actions in IBM speak) are now a quarterly occurrence.  Employee morale and enthusiasm are incredibly low, most of us wondering when, not if, we will be fired. Work from home is being eliminated & many in the company are being given the choice of moving to an entirely new geographic location or losing their jobs. 

Senior management, starting with Ginni, is inept and rudderless. 19 consecutive quarters of negative growth with no signs of a turnaround in sight. They have completely  abandoned IBM's core values.

- Awesome odd benefits like cheap rental cars, awesome for traveling
- Work from home allowed (though I hear they are ending this soon)
- There are smart people here who are great to work with","Working at IBM was the most confusing and horrifying experience of my professional life.  I joined after the start up I was working for was acquired by them.  At first I thought this would be an amazing opportunity and a place I could build my career at.  I honestly went into this thanking the universe for such an amazing turn of luck.  As time went on this feeling was replaced with more a sense of ""it could be worse"" to ""At least I have golden hand cuffs"" to ""This place is insane and makes me hate my work life, IBM is making me lazy and stupid""

Some of the worst parts of the job center around how the company organizes itself and the general bloat in employees and management.  There are countless people working at the company that have a vested interest in nothing changing as their skills have stagnated over the last 10-20 years.  This place and their job are literally all they know.  A few examples of this:

- for a company that prides itself on technology it is embarrassing they still widely use Notes as the primary email client.  Some job duties have no other option but to use Notes as the tool even as email has shifted to a web client. The software is unstable, slow, and non-intuitive

- In my department we used a database that was initially written in 1968.  That's not a joke.  When the idea of men walking on the moon was science fiction IBM created the database that is widely used for ticketing in critical needs roles at IBM

- the interface for said DB is again a plugin for a notes client

- Efforts to create a new interface that was web based and levels easier to use were actively thwarted by management that didn't want to change the way things were.

- efforts to change the way we communicate to even just allow us to talk with our colleagues more easily were actively prevented.

The direct manager I had was also verbally abusive and took to screaming at me during a meeting while a colleague was in the room.  The event was so bad I had to involve several upper level managers to get him to stop screaming at me and mentioning my personal life outside the office in a negative context. He didn't understand the product we were on as he took over parts of the team after acquisition.  He would tell us completely wrong information and ban us from performing actions he felt were bad in his gut.  A key example of this was telling us not to suggest to customer to upgrade versions of their software because he felt it ""Caused more problems than it solved"".  This led to a lengthy talk about how the software we used was actually built using technology that is designed to be upgraded easily and often. I even confirmed this with the engineering lead and lead release engineer who had horrified looks on their face when I told them this.  

That same call also involved a 30 minute debate about whether agile or waterfall was the best way to build software today.  My manager wanted to go back to the way things were and just release software once a year when all the bugs were worked out.  I kept trying to calmly explain no one does that today. He countered with how frustrating it was to have a new release every 2 months.  I tried to tell him many companies have new releases several times a day.  IN any event it was a pointless conversation as I had no power to change the release cycle and neither did he.  The software was built and released as it was but he refused to support it that way. 

For an easy example during start up days the time to solve a Sev 1 support issue would be measures in hours to days at the most.  At IBM this was more like weeks to months.  By the time a fix ever came around the customer had usually forgotten about it or moved on to other projects or products.  

IBM is not innovative enough anymore to create new things itself in the software realm.  Instead they are acquiring companies to jusy buy the tech as they transition to a software model of business.  The problem is they are trying to force software start ups into their very old business model when they should be changing themselves to the new way of doing business.",3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0

- A few weeks before the layoffs, IBM changed the severance policy from 2 weeks pay for every year of service to 4 weeks severance no matter how long you were there. 35 years and you still get 4 weeks of pay. To me, that should be of great concern for those interested in IBM.

You tend to work on small teams and get to know people in your cadre.  Those people are usually pretty good.  They have also figured out how to recruit from colleges and hire a lot of very bright college grads and still train them.  Most of the time, you are working with good people.  There is also lots of on-line training available.  On your own time, you can learn just about anything you want related to technology.  They have amazing resources available to all employees, if you can find them.
Senior management seems to be embracing actual change toward more modern business practices.  Performance ratings are a little less arbitrary than they used to be.  They are trying really hard to use agile methods in everything they do.  They seem to have discovered--and are taking seriously--customer satisfaction.","It is very difficult to find resources.
