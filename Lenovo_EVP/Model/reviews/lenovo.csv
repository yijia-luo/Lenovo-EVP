Your insurance premiums are much lower than some of the contractors who have to go through their contracting company.  There's a gym, nurse, and cafeteria on the campus (contractors are not allowed to use the gym nor the nurse).  The company usually offers free flu shots for the employees.  On many teams, employees are assigned a Lenovo ThinkPad to use.  The profit sharing bonuses are nice.  Some of the contests, benefits, spiffs, and gifts in the sales teams are great (one year lease on cars and Rolex watches were given out in the past).  They have an employee purchase discount on both the Lenovo PCs and Moto phones.  They have many community events such as assisting Habitat for Humanity, etc...  Ten years ago, they used to have free lunches to celebrate Thanksgiving and Christmas.  Technically you have unlimited vacation (with manager approval).  *****If you know the right people, work on a good team, and have a good manager, this is a great place to work.*****","Some of the cons have been inherited from IBM - these include some inefficient structure and some software in some areas (Lenovo is making some attempts to change this).  As mentioned before, there's a lot of corporate politics in some groups and I feel that some of this came over from IBM (at least my retired IBM friends confirm this).  Some of the managers seem to fall into the category of ""they were great at what they did in their previous position, but they are not great at managing people"".    Not always an issue, but some teams have to work closely with their counterparts in China and this could mean working later or earlier, due to the time differences.  There seems to be a high turnover in some teams and there is seems to be a corporate wide layoff every two years.

Nowhere is this more true than in the workstation business.  One such leader in a sales conference asked his audience if they would ""grow old with him"". Clearly he does not understand sales people want to get rich not old. One reportedly has anger management issues, and once threw a whiteboard marker at an employee for which he was demoted.  This person continues to use his bully pulpit to threaten, force out or demote people who stand up to him. 

To make up for his shortcomings Lenovo management rushed in a former top HP guy who was booted off his job there within a year. He seems to be poaching from HP as revenge on his former employer.

121,"""Utter Rubbish""",I worked at Lenovo full-time for more than 8 years,"Salary is good to start, benefits are good","Job growth is non-existent. Lenovo almost always hires externally to fulfill its needs. The obsession with directional change mentioned by many other reviewers here is true, and when that occurs, many of these new hires find themselves responsible for a position not even close to what they were hired on for just a year or even six months prior. This definite is a sign of a company that does not have an actionable nor sustainable long-term vision. Of course, this is what senior management is responsible for and has failed to deliver on much of the time since the acquisition from IBM in 2005.

Senior management is obsessed with changing direction as a response to failing to meet goals that were unrealistic to begin with. During my tenure at Lenovo, I saw a culture of 'yes men' as opposed to any real leadership. I say 'yes-men', because the vast majority of ""leaders"" are male. While there are some females in management, the majority of them are in lower-to-middle management.

Lenovo's culture is also quite toxic. Bullying, negative gossip, and ostracization is frequent. This is actually encouraged by management with what they term ""visibility."" Indeed, it is more important to be seen and heard by the right people than actually do an excellent job and help your team or division succeed. If you can argue your way out of a poor job performance or blame someone else convincingly, it is believed. Many have learned to game this culture and work their way up the ladder. Some are moderately competent in their roles, whilst many lack even the fundamental skills necessary to succeed. The way around this is to either:

1) Pull rank and say ""I know better because I'm a higher band"" and then ultimately blame the impending failure  on something else, or

2) use your internal connections to find a way around the person who is in a lower band to push your agenda forward and explain it in such a way that people in senior management (who have no clue as to what's going on besides how much money is being made and spent) to agree with you and take your side.  

I have seen many well designed plans thrown out the window in favor of ludicrously complex designs because of political posturing and power-plays. This, of course, makes it significantly harder for the people actually doing the work to successfully complete the requirements, so the answer to that is to have them work 12 hour days and weekends for weeks or months at a time.  A VP I used to work for heard about how hard our team was working for months on end and his response to this was ""I don't care, as long as it gets done."" If you complain about being worked to death, you WILL be made fun of publicly by someone who out-ranks you and finds this type of humor acceptable. This workload isn't an exception to the rule, this is how it is 70% of the time at Lenovo. 

Layoffs occur multiple times a year and have for many years now. Management leverages globalization as an argument to tell you that you don't deserve job growth, a shot at a promotion, or to be paid better despite those of us that pushed through the hard times, make our respective teams succeed and have a significantly larger workload than many people at higher bands have.  Several people in my role or similar have been told that management can get two engineers from China or India for the same amount of money we are being paid at Lenovo. While there is some truth to this, I would ask how this is a motivating factor to get me to work even harder at a company that puts more and more responsibility on its current workers and gives a 3% raise for the lucky ones, while external hires have more visibility, less responsibility, and generally a 10%-20% larger paycheck. 

Sadly, Lenovo is not one team. It is many internal divisions competing against one another for funding, indeed, survival. Divisions use one another to meet quotas, get ahead, or finish a product, then have to convince upper management how much they did themselves. The ironic thing is, many of these divisions are so interdependent so by trying to make one another look bad, this form of ""leadership"" is only really hurting the company as a whole. The only other companies I have seen use this model is organised crime.

Lenovo also uses a bell-curve rating to force their employees into categories of 1, 2, or 3; 1 being excellent and rare to achieve; 2 being the norm for many hard working, competent people (2+ being higher on the 2 scale, 2- being lower, but not quite 3), and 3 for people who aren't doing their job, or more to the point, people that management does not like. Since bonuses are a large percentage of employees' salary, we are forced to compete against one another for the '2' positions. The '1' ratings are reserved for people with more visibility and who are favored, generally quite subjectively, by management.  As an added bonus, this is a zero-sum rating system. For every 1, there must be a 3, for every 2+, there must be a 2-. This, again, forces people to work together in the short term, but then people that want to make a career here will not think twice about stabbing their co-workers in the back to get ahead.",2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0

On my first day on the job, I was surprised to learn that I had been re-assigned to a different team then I had interviewed with. There isn't much direction on the team I'm assigned to, and I've probably only spoken to my manager, about 4 times in the past 3 months.

I've found that instead of working together, many of the internal teams appear to be in direct competition with each other. There is way too much political back and forth for me at Lenovo. As, an engineer, I want to work hard and want to contribute to the company, but I feel like I am held back by the politics and the lack of an engineering culture. The work that has been done by the existing team, is of very poor quality. This is further validated, as the manager of my team appears to prioritize Cheap and Fast, over Good.

163,"""A $35 billion startup.""",I worked at Lenovo full-time for more than 3 years,"The review title refers to a phrase I used to hear from time to time at Lenovo, used to describe the experience of working there. There is a lot of energy at Lenovo and a focus on the future. It's a young company and makes big moves. It moves quickly In this sense, it's like a startup. It's also a large, international company. This can obviously help the more nimble startup culture by providing capital and infrastructure, but it hindered Lenovo sometimes too, via bureaucracy and commitments to legacy systems.

Lenovo's employees are warm and helpful. They are smart and most care about the company in a real way. I worked with many professionals whom I respect and that is one of the best parts of working there.

In sales, one had considerable leeway to run things in one's territory as one saw fit. Management was open to new ideas and I implemented some of my own. Some failed, some succeeded;  the openness to new ideas is a testament to Lenovo's culture.

I am grateful to Lenovo and for the time I worked there. My experience there is defined by the fact that I didn't have extensive work history at the time of my hire; and working at Lenovo was my first experience working for a large corporation. Lenovo hired me soon after I graduated college and was open to taking a chance, which I'll never forget. I adapted well to the life of working at a large company. 

If you've worked at other companies and/or are coming in with a long resume, your mileage may vary. Lenovo is a great place to work that does have challenges; I would work there again if the right opportunity came along.","I did work through a contracting agency before being hired on full time. I was paid well and treated well. There was tension among people who got hired from the contractors' pool and as a contractor you weren't eligible to certain things like sales contests. I was treated as a member of the team and valued. There were just some annoying limits of being a contractor.

Lenovo consistently paid a little bit less across most jobs where I learned the salary against the industry. Pay can be a touchy subject for management but the fact is that not only was I miffed about my own pay towards the end of my stint; but competent, creative and innovative coworkers consistently left to take higher-paying jobs elsewhere. 

Speaking strictly regarding my time there there were manufacturing delays that put our shipping times well behind industry average. This was around the IBM x86 acquisition and year after it. It went on a long time. Global technology supply chains are incredibly complex. However, I think that considering that we faced serious problems for well over a year to the point that large sales were canceled and returned combined with the fact that Lenovo had many people whose expertise was global supply chains working on supply chains they themselves built, I think it's appropriate to criticize poor performance here. This was a political issue in my time. I have only my own observation that it was ongoing for a very long time and rumors I heard that certain senior managers were intransigent to change. Some had to be forged out to fix the problem, but this took a long time. I hope this has changed.",4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0

Managers inform their team of other job opportunities within the company, possibly at the expense of committed projects.  Management trusts mid/senior engineers appropriately. (Minimal observation of unwarranted  ""micro-management"").  Top-tier engineers are rewarded financially through pay increases and semi-annual pay bonuses.  Pay is reported as above average when compared to salaries of senior engineers for other local companies... However, my personal interactions with other senior engineers in the RTP / Raleigh area suggest the average salary reported by Glassdoor and other summaries are significantly lower than my experience and conversations with engineers with similar skills would report.","Layoffs *can* be more frequent than other companies, and may include long-term employees that are considered highly skilled engineers.",5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0

171,"""Inside Sales""",I worked at Lenovo full-time for more than a year,Met some great people that I have stayed in contact with over the years. Solid attempt at work/life balance. Good/fun culture. Great place to start out your sales career and get B2B sales experience.,"Where to start.... Extremely low compensation compared to the rest of the industry.  Unrealistic goals and expectations. Resources are very scarce. Can't keep employees. Layoffs or ""reorganizations"" happen frequently, and seem to have no rhyme or reason. I've seen successful inside reps get laid off before lazy, unsuccessful reps. Constantly ""growing"" and downsizing. Creating jobs and then cutting those same jobs. Very immature company as a whole for how long they have been around.

You start as a contractor with an even lower salary + capped commission. Management is hit or miss. Some managers are very selective and play favorites. Individuals who are lazy, unproductive, and unresponsive can often be converted to a full time employee before others simply by brown nosing (barely metrics based at all).  Don't get me wrong here - there are some great employees/reps/managers, but they often go unrecognized. 

Once you become full time, you get an extremely modest ""pay bump"" to your salary (still far below the industry standard for the same role). They say you now have an ""uncapped"" commission structure, which isn't true. If you are on track to overachieving, management has the ability (and will often do so), provide quota relief to individuals underachieving and tack that on to the ones overachieving to make things ""fair"". This, in turn, penalizesthose employees who are actually doing well. 

The LASR program is a good concept on paper, but also allows for highly disgruntled employees. What if you were a loyal employee with a company for 2+ years and they hire a recent college grad (with little to no experience) to join your team and do the exact same role as you, but start them at significantly higher pay?

As I stated this is a great ""job"" for the recent grad who wants to get their feet wet in B2B sales, build experience, grow their personal brand, and move on.. I say ""job"" because after about a year with the company, I saw no opportunity, and no desire to grow a career within Lenovo and started looking elsewhere.",4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

Along with the cuts there isn't a lot of new talent coming in bring fresh ideas.

There are too many layers of management, while the managers mostly work very hard and are good at what they do, they don't seem to be delegated any really decision making authority on products.  When new ideas need to bubble up through 6 layers of management they tend to die without any real consideration.",5.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0

While talent exists within Lenovo, it is rarely found at the executive level.  A favorite quote among the executive team is ""the strategy is clear"", when generally they have not formulated a strategy at all.

All big companies have bad pockets, but this team has surely been the most corrupt and politically-diluted that I have ever worked on.
Approximately two months ago, we received new org charts and official announcements that there were people promoted into positions that were never posted or opened for applications. Sadly, this won’t be the first time I have seen blatant unfairness in my time at the company and in this department. After being personally solicited for meaningful charitable contributions by upper management, we had one person make quite a large donation that was not anonymous (it was listed by their name on the charity website) and they have been promoted 2x in less than a year. So if these are the paths to success, hard work will get you nowhere at this company. Be prepared to donate or brown nose your way to the team of favorites because that is the only way that you can succeed here. Hard work is not recognized, only favorites and folks who chose to play the awful game of politics. 
The recent organizational promotions, which were confirmed by HR to not be official, indicate that there is zero regard for fairness and they are even openly ok with being unfair. It is not fair to the employees who may wish to apply and get an opportunity to obtain the position, and it is not fair to myself and my teammates who may have missed an opportunity to have more qualified management. 
Also, there should be no surprises that the same rules do not apply to everyone. We have plenty of folks who heavily abuse the vacation policy and experience no consequences. Maybe you will be lucky and be one of those folks, but I have worked every day I have taken PTO, and also some holidays, only to sit back and watch those who abuse the system get rewarded. 
We also have folks who do not adhere to a professional dress code but suffer no consequences. All the while, we have repeatedly had high school speeches on dress code. It seems the folks who do these things get away with it while everyone else pays the price.
This is not an ethical place to work and honestly, I believe that some of the actions that myself and my teammates have experienced are not even legal.
I would advise to stay away from Lenovo if you have values and would like a fair place to work. I believe there are some good pockets at the company, but I have no located them yet. I just know that North America Services has embodied nothing but stress and hijinks, and no one does anything about it despite the changes in more fake management.",3.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,1.0
